            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>MEN that perform great things have generally their particular Hiſtorians, who in their Writings Record their Actions; But theſe are many times no more than the Flatterers of their choiceſt and moſt memorable Deeds, not making any mention of their Vices and Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages: a thing which this ſhort Story of the Late Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> cannot be ſaid to be guilty of, at leaſt to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the Authors knowledg. From his very Birth, to the fiftieth year of his Age there is no notice taken, no
<pb facs="tcp:101014:3"/> mention made of him, neither in Hiſtory nor in any publick Acts or Records; ſo that in all that time it is impoſſible there ſhould be any thing conſiderable concerning him delivered to poſterity; only that he lay under the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <q>Res anguſta domi—</q> How he employ'd his time from the forty ſeventh year of his Age, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the Reader has here a ſhort but impartial accompt; from which they that are pleaſed with variety of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and love to obſerve the Intreagues of Ambition, and all the windings and doublings of Human Policy, cannot chooſe but receive as much ſatisfaction as ſo ſhort a Compendium can afford; and yet not ſo ſhort neither, if we conſider in what a narrow compaſs the
<pb facs="tcp:101014:3"/> ſeveral Lives of <hi>Plutarch</hi> lie, in few of which there is more diverſity of Tranſaction to be found. It being a thing greatly to be admired, that a Prince of ſo little Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reaſon of the ſmall extent of his Territories, ſhould nevertheleſs ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his affairs, as that the chiefeſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of Europe ſtill ſought his friendſhip, at no ſmall expences of their own. While, by a wary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable change of parties, he ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf entire. But I ſhall not anticipate the Reader with a Preface Relation, when the Story it ſelf is ſo near at hand.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE AND ACTIONS OF <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard van Galle,</hi> Biſhop of MUNSTER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard de Galle</hi> was bred up by his Uncle <hi>Bernard Malingcrock</hi> out of meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Charity, being the poor Orphan of an unfortunate Gentleman whoſe Eſtate the Law took from him, and who dy'd in Priſon for having ſlain another Gentleman, of which we ſhall make a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101014:5"/> more ample relation in the following Pages, he little thought that he was then hatching up not only ſo large a Theam for Hiſtory, but one that ſhould make it ſo much his buſineſs to trouble the repoſe of ſo many Countries, and bring ſo many Kings and Princes to intereſt themſelves in his Affairs, while he either ruined or helped to ruin ſo many vaſt Territories.</p>
            <p>Hiſtories already written are plentifully ſtored with examples of perſons, who from the meaneſt condition of mankind, have been advanced to the higheſt dignities of Empire and Soveraignty. Of theſe, ſome have reigned and ruled with great honor and applauſe; but others, and they the greater number, have ruin'd their Subjects, and been plagues to their Neighbors. I confeſs, to name them all or to make a Catalogue of their Actions would be too tedious, and therefore I leave it to the judgment of them who have any knowledg of the Actions of our Biſhop, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought to be rank'd in the leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the firſt, or the greater number of the latter.</p>
            <p>Before the time that he was advanc'd to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and till the Year, 1650. there is no mention made of his name in any Book that I know of. But ſince that, he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion enough to men both to write and talk of him; though much more to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then otherwiſe, and therefore his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will never be accompted the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101014:5"/> in Story. Since then we find nothing remarkable in the firſt part of his Life but what has been already obſerv'd in the Preface, we ſhall preſently go on to his Election to the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Dignity, which was as full of troubles and interruptions as his Government after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Nevertheleſs before we come to that, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomthing of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition, by which (not bridling but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſomenting his Paſſions) he executed thoſe things which were done by him when he had power and opportunity to do what he intended.</p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>Valkenier</hi> in his <hi>Europe Troubl'd,</hi> p. 138. deſcribes his humour to be ambitious, martial, reſtleſs, inclin'd to change, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether covetous to heap up Riches for his Heirs. Certainly his Ambition and Paſſion for the Wars which he occaſion'd were immoderate, and this was the main motive that incited him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo many Actions. It was more for ruining his Neighbours Country then for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his own or his own ſubjects. More ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſeek occaſions for War, then to ſue for Peace. He loved the Art of War better than the Art of Preaching. He wore at the ſame time the Helmet and the Mitre, the Sword and the Croſier, but preferr'd the former always before the latter.</p>
            <p>And indeed he was a good Souldier upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions. He was ſubtle and full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, and very artfully diſſembl'd his Deſigns
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101014:6"/> till ripe for Execution; and continu'd open Friendſhip till he was ready to ſtrike theſe whom he deſign'd to fall out withal. When he intended Eaſtward, he ſeemed to bend to the Weſt. Our State, among others, has had often experience of this particular. His Conduct, beſides that he was never deceiv'd by his Generals in the number of his men, appear'd at the Siege of <hi>Groning,</hi> where his Order and Diſcipline were without blame.</p>
            <p>Toward the end of <hi>July</hi> he took a review of his whole Army. In the Morning he call'd his men to their Arms by beat of Drum and ſound of Trumpet. After that he cauſed Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that every Commander ſhould forthwith repair to their ſeveral Charges, and Order the Souldiers under their Commanders into their ſeveral Ranks and Files, as well the Horſe as the Foot; Then he appointed certain Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to count the Ranks and Files, and tell how many was in every Company. The Roll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleated, was deliver'd to the Biſhop, who paid out his mony according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of men given into his hands. By which means he knew exactly how many men he had in his Service, Every Month he made the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, whereby he did not only gain time, but prevented the deceits of Officers upon the like occaſions.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, he had the Courage of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; and he ſhewed his undauntedneſs at the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101014:6"/> ſame Siege. He went frequently into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to take care of things, and to correct ſuch miſcarriages as he obſerv'd, never truſting to any one perſon but himſelf. And ſtill as he paſs'd along, it behov'd the Souldiers either to be delving or ſhooting; So that they lov'd his room much better then his company. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſtay'd two or three hours in the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, hazarding his perſon in the moſt dangerous places. Nevertheleſs he was prudent for all that; for he never expos'd himſelf to thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but he was attended by nine or ten perſons, habited like Footmen in the ſame Livery as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which prevented his being diſcover'd by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Thus our Biſhop ſhew'd himſelf to be a brave and vigilant Captain: but ſuch a one as undertook unneceſſary Wars, and ſuch as the occaſions thereof were ſought by himſelf. Should it be objected that the Sword of a Prince, and the Biſhops Crozier have no correſpondence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it may be anſwered that he was not only a Spiritual but Temporal Prince. Should any one go farther and ask the ſame queſtion as was asked the Biſhop of <hi>Cologn</hi> upon the ſame occaſion, <hi>If the Devil take the Secular, what muſt become of the Spiritual Prince?</hi> We can give no anſwer till we hear what the Biſhop ſaid for himſelf.</p>
            <p>His reſtleſs humour has been ſufficiently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. He never could be at quiet; but there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101014:7"/> was a neceſſity for him to be in Arms, or in ſome conteſt before the Chamber of <hi>Spiers,</hi> ſomtimes againſt his own City and Subjects, ſomtimes againſt the States General, the Dukes of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> &amp;c. No perſon that had any intricate and perplex'd cauſe needed have done any more then gone to him; for he never denyed them his Aſſiſtance, eſpecially if he perceived any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage accrewing to himſelf.</p>
            <p>All the world knows how inconſtant he was in his words and his actions. The Alliances which he confirm'd by ſolemn Oath and his Epiſcopal Croſs, endured no longer than ſtood with his Intereſt and Convenience: He never continued long in Friendſhip with any Prince, whom he did not either leave in the lurch, or elſe become his Enemy. <hi>England, France,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and ſeveral others can well teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame.</p>
            <p>His Avarice was a great, if not the principal cauſe of his Inconſtancy. For when he had got the ſum agreed upon, he offered his aſſiſtance to another, to make a new profit to himſelf, though it were to the diſadvantage of him that was the firſt purchaſer.</p>
            <p>He was ſo much a ſlave to his Covetouſneſs, that it was uſually ſaid of him that he would ſerve the Devil for mony; he would willingly have had all the mony that was in the world, for gain was the chiefeſt part of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Neither did he ſpare any deceit, or act of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101014:7"/> violence which was profitable to him: For which reaſon he was a continual ſtumbling-block to his Neighbours, and a thorn in their Eyes; ſo that the Emperour never durſt put any confidence in him, finding him to be of the diſpoſition of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> whoſe hand was againſt all the world.</p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>Valekenier</hi> has very well obſerv'd that profit had the only Aſcendent over him, as being the only thing whereat he aim'd. The words of that famous Writer are theſe: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Whatever filled and crammed his Cheſts and Coffers was his Intereſt as he has openly confeſſed himſelf, and has given the world reaſon to believe by his actions. And indeed, as he is an Eccleſiaſtical Prince, that cannot leave his Biſhoprick to his Kindred, and will therefore be nothing endama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the ruin of it, for that reaſon be only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to heap together vaſt Treaſures for his Heirs, who could expect from him nothing but ready mony. So that if the States of the</hi> United Provinces <hi>had offered him more mony then the</hi> French, <hi>he would have ſoon laid aſide his old Antipathy, and have become their choiceſt Friend. Though he knew well, that if by the uncertain chance of War be ſhould happen to be expell'd his Biſhoprick, a rich Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in</hi> France <hi>(well deſerved by his Faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices) might prove more profitable to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Europe troubl'd p. 183.</note> 
               <hi>him then all his Biſhoprick, whoſe Inhabitants were ſo impoveriſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide what we have already ſaid, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of pity. He is accuſed to have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101014:8"/> pocketed up the mony which has been ſent by other Princes or Kings to make a divertive War for their convenience, and then to have laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burthens upon his own Subjects. That he quartered Souldiers continually in great numbers upon his Subjects, who made no ſin of violating married women, raviſhing Virgins and committing dayly Robberies, the relations whereof never moved his heart. When a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable perſon and very aged, belonging to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church, laid before him one day the miſerable ſufferings of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as well by their Taxes, as the Inſolence of the Souldiers, he made anſwer. <hi>That it was not for him to ſuffer himſelf to be inſulted over by his Neighbours, but to defend his Honour. Which could not be done without a War; and to make War there was a neceſſity for mony and Souldiers. The firſt he could legally demand from his Subjects, as being ſet over them for their ſafety and honour. For the other, it was impoſſible to Diſcipline them ſo exactly. If his Subjects did fuffer any hardſhip, he was ſorry for it. But as theſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were the companions of War; he hop'd ere long for better times. That if they conſidered what others ſuffered, they had reaſon to count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, and to thank God that they had a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince that would take no affront, but was mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful their Honor.</hi> He ſuffer'd his Souldiers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe <hi>inſolencies</hi> in his Enemies Countries that the people dreaded the very name of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterians.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101014:8"/> The <hi>French</hi> were rigorous enough in thoſe Places and Cities of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> where they had their Garriſons, but not to be compar'd with the Biſhops men for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported that at the Siege of <hi>Groning,</hi> ſome of his Chief Officers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their ſorrow for the loſs of ſo many brave and valiant perſons; and deſired him to have pity upon the miſerable cries of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beſeeching him at the ſame time that care might be taken of them, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for anſwer, <hi>How! Are you one of my Officers and ſuffer your heart to melt upon the ſight of a few dead men, or the ſight and groans of the wounded? A good Souldier ought to have as little Compaſſion as the Devil.</hi> However he would ſometimes diſguiſe his Natural Cruelty, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear tender and pitiful, for fear of diſtaſting his Souldiers, and being alſo afraid leſt his Subjects ſhould have an utter averſion againſt him.</p>
            <p>There are ſome perhaps who having read thus far may accuſe me of prejudice and partiality. But they muſt know that as yet, we have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Hiſtory, we have only made a prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary deſcription of the humour and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop, in reſpect of whom we thought ourſelves not ſo much confined to the Duty of a Hiſtorian as to the bounds of Truth, wherein we have follow'd the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101014:9"/> of the time, as well in <hi>High German,</hi> as <hi>Dutch.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hildeſheim, Paderborn, Liege</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> dyed in the Year 1650. The Archiepiſcopal See fell to <hi>Maximilian Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavariae,</hi> after he had been eight years <hi>Coadjutor</hi> to his Uncle. A while after he was alſo Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Hildeſheim.</hi> The Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Munſter</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Signor Chriſtopher Bernard de Galle,</hi> though by vertue of an Election altogether confuſed and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, cauſed by the diſſenſion between the Dean and the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of <hi>Munſter,</hi> of which more in due place.</p>
            <p>Hiſtorians differ as to the employment which <hi>Monſieur Chriſtopher Bernard</hi> enjoyed before he was Elected. Some will have him to have been Warden of the Chapter. <hi>Gotfred Schultz</hi> in his Chronicle of the Year 1650. p. 23. writes thus: 'At <hi>Munſter</hi> the Chapter of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral put by ſeveral conſiderable perſons that ſtood for the Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, and at laſt choſe for their Biſhop, <hi>Monſieur Chriſtopher Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> their Warden. In the beginning of the little Preface there are theſe words; A Warden was advanced to be Biſhop. But in the eighth part of the <hi>Theatre of Europe.</hi> Fol. 91. we find that his Uncle <hi>Malingcrot,</hi> Dean of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral had advanc'd him in the Chapter. Both the one and the other may be true, that is to ſay,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101014:9"/> that firſt he might have been only <hi>Sacriſtain,</hi> and after that preferr'd higher, and ſo by his Uncles means attain the Biſhoprick.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard,</hi> was ſcarcely advanc'd to the Chair, but word was brought him every day, that the Citizens of <hi>Munſter</hi> not being ſatisfied with his Election, talkt of him with a great deal of ſcorn and contempt: that they continually divulg'd bitter Lampoons and reproaches againſt him, and that they gave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſpect to his high Dignity. Part of this indeed was true: but his Flatterers had added much more then was really ſo: and this it was that exaſperated the Biſhop againſt them: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he concealed his hatred for a time. Many of the Magiſtrates were willing to have puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Authors of thoſe Satyrs; but others privately favour'd them, ſo that they could not agree upon that point among themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is reported that this diſcontent among the Citizens on the one ſide was this, that after the Chapter had in ſuch an irregular manner paſſed by ſo many perſons of worth, they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to ſo high a Dignity not only the ſon of a private Gentleman, which was tolerable enough, but the ſon of a Criminal, which was inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. On the other ſide becauſe they well enough underſtood by ſeveral actions of <hi>Chriſtopher Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> in his mean Eſtate, what they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him, when he came to be a Prince.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101014:10"/>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Bernard Malingcrot</hi> his Uncle a very learned man, as moſt Writers affirm, but very ſelf-willed withal, became his mortal enemy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Election, and proſecuted him publickly every where not only in his common ſpeeches but his writings, reproaching him that his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was neither regular nor juſt; that it was faulty both in the manner and the perſon, and that <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard</hi> ought not to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for lawful Biſhop. All which more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the people againſt him, as being a perſon that had never been in any credit amongſt them, whereas <hi>Malingcrot</hi> had lived in long Reputation within the City.</p>
            <p>And now it will be time for us to declare the reaſon why the Uncle ſo hated his Pupil, as alſo to relate the manner of the Biſhops Election, and what happened before and after.</p>
            <p>It is a thing well known by the Popes Bulls or Right Eccleſiaſtical, that when the Epiſcopal See happens to be vacant, it is the Deans duty to aſſemble a Chapter within ſix months, for the choice of another Biſhop, otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expiration of that time the Pope has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ſupply the vacancy by putting in any one of his own choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malingcrot</hi> would willingly. have been Biſhop himſelf, and indeed deſerved to have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that Dignity, as well for his wit and learning as for his extraction: which may ſeem improbable, conſidering the meanneſs of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101014:10"/> birth; but is allowed however for truth, in regard that <hi>Malingcrot,</hi> was related to the Biſhop by the Mothers ſide and not by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malingcrot</hi> therefore aſpiring to the Mitre, delayed the Election much longer then was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the <hi>Canons;</hi> ſo that the fifth month was already at an end, and no day yet prefix'd; whereby he thought more eaſily to have attain'd his ends. But many of the members of the Chapter, eſpecially the younger ſort, had little or no kindneſs for him. For he was a ſevere man, and one that while he was Dean had not only ſharply rebuk'd them in words but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted rude Penances upon them. So that they fear'd he would be more rigorous when he came to be Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Thus while he delayed to call the Chapter, notwithſtanding the importunities of ſeveral, the Members of the Colledg met <hi>Chriſtopher Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard de Galle,</hi> the Deans Nephew at a Feaſt near their Colledg. They were there very frolick, and at length in the height of their jollity they began to cry aloud, <hi>Long live Biſhop Bernard.</hi> Which acclamations when they came <hi>Malingcrots</hi> ears he took them for a good Omen, in regard his name was alſo <hi>Bernard,</hi> believign himſelf to be the perſon intended. But ſoon after he was inform'd that the Chapter had proceeded very far toward the Election, and that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated his Nephew Monſieur <hi>de Galle,</hi> to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101014:11"/> Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> which Election they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to conſent to, and confirm with his ſignet.</p>
            <p>The Dean was very ill ſatisfied with what had been done; he upbraided the Canons with their ill and diſreſpectful language towards him, according to his uſual cuſtom; and for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their duty towards him, without his knowledg and conſent, they had aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an improper place to make a Biſhop. That it belonged to him, as Dean, according to the Eccleſiaſtical cuſtoms and priviledges, to call a Chapter, and take their voices in order. Which not being done, but having acted contrary to Rules with a premeditated deſign, the Election was illegal and void: and for that reaſon, he would never approve of it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Chapter would not alter the reſolution which they had taken, and made their Applications to the Pope to confirm the Biſhop newly Elected. <hi>Malingcrot</hi> vigorouſly oppos'd it; alledging among other reaſons, that their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was altogether illegal, being done contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Law and Form, without his knowledg, as Dean; without any neceſſity or apprehenſion of danger, when there was time enough to have proceeded legally; beſides that they had choſen a perſon not fitting or proper to be admitted to ſo high a calling, which ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by perſons of irreprehenſible converſations. Now it was known to all the world that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101014:11"/> of him who was Elected to the Biſhoprick had killed another Gentleman, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had been deprived of his Eſtate, and dy'd in Priſon.</p>
            <p>The Chapter alledg'd on the other ſide, that neceſſity had compell'd them to paſs to this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The needleſs delay of the Dean put them in danger of loſing their great priviledg of a free choice; there being ſo much time elapſed. As for the Criminal act of the Father of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Biſhop, they excuſed it in this manner; ſaying, that it could not be accompted a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Crime, ſince it was not puniſh'd with loſs of life; and therefore that could be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to keep his ſon from the benefit of their Election.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malingcrot</hi> reply'd, that then when they made their choice there was time enough to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to due form. That it was in his breſt to appoint the time, ſo that he left time enough for the Election. That he would not loſe his priviledg of limitation of time; that a particular favour to let a crime go unpuniſhed did not juſtifie the action. At length by his writings he ſo far prevail'd with <hi>Innocent</hi> the X. as to forbear the Confirmation of <hi>Chriſtopher Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> till the fifth year, that is to ſay, for ſo long time as the Pope ſhould live. But when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the VII. came to the Chair in the Year 1655. he forthwith confirm'd him in his Dignity, and ſo <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard</hi> prevail'd at length.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101014:12"/>
            <p>So long as <hi>Malingcrot</hi> liv'd at <hi>Munſter</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed giving out invective ſpeeches againſt the Biſhop, and many as well of the Council as of the people gave credit to him. For in regard that he had bred him, every one believed that he could not chuſe but know his Genius and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition better then another: And certainly the preceding life of the Biſhop had not been ſo void of blame, but that he had given occaſion enough to let the world ſee ſeveral of his vices. This was that which engag'd the Biſhop, who reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Coeſweld,</hi> to Excommunicate the Dean, his Uncle; who after that retired to <hi>Cologn,</hi> where he met with <hi>Sanfelicio,</hi> the Popes Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio at that time; to whom he made out his buſineſs ſo well, that he was not only freed from his Excommunication, but alſo had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted him to return to <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very thing did not a little contribute to the enſuing troubles; particularly then when upon the Feaſt of St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle he ſhew'd himſelf in all his Eccleſiatical Robes. Old and young, men and women, in ſhort, all ſorts of people crouded to ſee him, overjoy'd at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Inſomuch that there was a univerſal cry among the multitude, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> Malingcrot <hi>ſtay with us, and let</hi> Galle <hi>go where he pleaſes.</hi> And this was that which made the buſineſs worſe, and excited a ſtronger inveteracy in the ſpirit of the Biſhop, not only againſt the Dean his Uncle, but againſt all the Citizens of <hi>Munſter.</hi> He imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101014:12"/> and perhaps not without reaſon, that he ſhould from time to time become more odious to them; and therefore he could not hope for much good from them. For this reaſon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Townſmen, that for the ſecurity of his perſon, they would receive an Epiſcopal Garriſon; and becauſe they gave him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, he ſought how to attain his ends by force.</p>
            <p>Before we go any farther, we will give the Reader a deſcription of his Town which is ſeated in <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> This Dioceſs contains twelve Cities, whoſe Magiſtrates are all of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religion; of all which <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> is the Metropolis. The Inhabitants are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly addicted to <hi>Tillage:</hi> they alſo breed and feed great ſtore of Cattel and Sheep, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Hogs, of which they make great advantage, by reaſon of the vaſt quantities of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> Hams which they ſend abroad into Forrain Parts. The Nobility govern the Country, and live in their Caſtles; but the Country and their Herds and Flocks afford them their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Only for their Agriculture, they have the priviledg to be ſerved by the Country people that are under their juriſdiction, being as it were their ſlaves, and whoſe duty it is at the firſt word to be at their ſervice. The place where now the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> ſtands, was formerly called, <hi>Mimgarde</hi> in the <hi>Dubigines</hi> or <hi>Dulgum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> It received the name of <hi>Munſter</hi> from the Latin word <hi>Monaſterium,</hi> ſignifying a Cloyſter
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101014:13"/> or Convent, which Biſhop <hi>Armaud</hi> the firſt, in the Reign of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> in the Year 785. when this Province was firſt made a Biſhoprick, cauſed to be built there in honor of the Holy <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> The Land round about it no way to be deſpiſed, no more than is all the reſt of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia.</hi> The City has nine Gates well provided and guarded with Bulwarks and Baſtions. There are three to the Eaſt, that of St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> St. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaiſe,</hi> and <hi>Horſt</hi> Gate. Two toward the South, St. <hi>Ludgers</hi> and St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s. Two to the Weſt, St. <hi>Maries</hi> Gate, and that of the <hi>Jews field.</hi> Two to the North, that of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>Newburgh</hi> Gate. The City is encompaſſed with a double Wall and a double Moat; which the River <hi>Aa</hi> fills with water, and then diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelf. It contains alſo five Colledges, that of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> the Cathedral, St. <hi>Ludgers,</hi> St. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rices,</hi> St. <hi>Martins</hi> and one more.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop therefore not being able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Citizens to anſwer his expectations, adjourned the Chapter of the Cathedral, and the greateſt part of the Nobility to <hi>Coſeweld.</hi> There the buſineſs was variouſly conſulted, but they could not come to any agreement, ſo that the Aſſembly brake up.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Malingcrot,</hi> from whom the Biſhop had taken away the Office of Dean, and who lived as an exile at <hi>Cologn,</hi> reſolved one day to reviſit the Town of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Feaſt of St. <hi>James.</hi> But before he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101014:13"/> could get into the Town, he was diſcovered by the Biſhops men, taken Priſoner and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop, who ſeriouſly exhorted him to quit his Rebellious humor and not to envy him the honor wherewith God had favoured him. But theſe calm words took no effect. On the contrary he began to upbraid his Nephew, with what he had done for him after his Fathers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and how he had preſerved him from the jaws of miſery; that he had made him a Canon, and then a member of the Chapter. But that after all his kindneſs, he had rewarded him with nothing but ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Biſhop made ſure of him; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Jeſuites and other Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were at his Devotion to perſuade him, but all to no purpoſe. So that at length he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed him of all his Dignities, and put him under a Guard of Souldiers in a certain houſe in the Country; and in that condition he ended his days. He ſhewed himſelf however very Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to all the poor Students that came to viſit him, of which his bounty drew a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But he received them all civilly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſmiſſed them but with a handſom gift, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them withal this Leſſon: When it ſhall be your turn to come to preferment, ſaid he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in your writings, and conſider what it was reduced me to this condition.</p>
            <p>Now in regard the Biſhop continued his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> could not but eaſily
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101014:14"/> conjecture, that he was making thoſe Warlike preparations againſt them. Nor did he want the aſſiſtance of others; For though <hi>Francis William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburgh,</hi> and <hi>Adolph de Veck,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> loved their Tranquillity too well, to intereſt themſelves in his troubles; yet the three Eccleſiaſtical Electors of <hi>Mayence, Treves</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> ſent him ſome of their Troops. Before he came to any Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he diſpatched to the City Monſieur <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,</hi> hereditary Marſhal, to make an agreement with the Inhabitants. The Council put in writing the cauſes why they could not entirely confide in their Prince, and what it was that burden'd the City. And indeed the Peace would ſoon have been concluded, would his Highneſs but have remitted or at leaſt abated the burthen of their Taxes. Nevertheleſs a Truce was agreed upon thereby to prevent farther extremities.</p>
            <p>With theſe hopes the Pacificators parted, and M. the Mareſchal took with him the Articles propos'd by the City together with their firſt Declaration. At that time <hi>Nicolas Dragter Syndie</hi> of the City, coming from the <hi>Hague,</hi> was taken Priſoner by the Biſhops men; which yet more exaſperated the Townſmen. Soon after open acts of Hoſtility began. The City put it ſelf in a poſture of defence. The Citizens ſtood to their Arms and took their Oaths at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil rather to loſe their lives than the Liberties and Priviledges of their Anceſtors.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101014:14"/>
            <p>The Biſhops Army was reported to be Nine Thouſand ſtrong, in Horſe and Foot. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail'd the City very vigorouſly, ſhooting conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and threw Fire-Balls into it, which ſet fire on ſeveral houſes. The Eccleſiaſtical perſons ran to the Churches, to beſeech Almighty God to infuſe thoughts of Peace into the hearts of the Biſhop and the Citizens. The old people and children, who were not fit for labour, went eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in public Proceſſions from one Church to another, accompany'd by the Dominicans. The luſty women were divided through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had their particular employments allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, ſome to fill Tubs of water, others carry'd Raw Hides to clap upon the Granado's and Fire-Balls that were thrown into the City. There was no place free from the Cannon-bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets which flew thick about their Ears. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that as one of the Prieſts was ſaying Maſs in the Church of St. <hi>John,</hi> while he was Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Hoſt, a Bullet took him away from the Altar. Nevertheleſs the Citizens made a Sally and kill'd a good number of the <hi>Epiſcoparians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of all this roaring of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, the Nobility ſought all means imaginable to bring things to a reconciliation. To which purpoſe they aſſembl'd together at <hi>Gueeſt.</hi> Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nobility flock'd in great numbers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill ſatisfi'd with the Biſhops proceedings; and ſome there were that did not forbear to ſay openly, That a Siege ſo pernicious and violent
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101014:15"/> was not the Act of a Prince, but of a Tyrant. They alſo ſent to his Highneſs their Letters of complaint in reference to the ſaid Siege; The Contents whereof were, That the agreement, which he was about to have made before, had been proſperouſly concluded, had he not ſo ſoon begun open Hoſtilities. That without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conſent of the Nobility and the Cities in general, he had brought Foreign Forces into the Country, and rais'd men upon his own particular Authority. That he had aſſaulted the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> like an Enemy contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the priviledges of the Country, which he had confirm'd himſelf in theſe words, <hi>We will not make any War or Alliance with any perſon, without the conſent of the Chapter of the Cathedral Church and other Eſtates of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And expreſly againſt what was concluded at the aſſembly at <hi>Coeſweld,</hi> that all new Levies ſhould be put off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they complain'd that he had put the Country, that had not yet recovered the miſeries of the preceding Wars, into a new confuſion, that he had ſhed the blood of the Innocent, made many Widows and Orphans whoſe tears and moans cry'd loud to Heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beſought him to raiſe his Siege, and ſend away his Foreigners; and for his own right, to ſtand to the determination of the Imperial Court. That he would no more oppreſs either them, the City or the Country, but that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101014:15"/> would aſſume the Peaceful thoughts of a Father, a Prince, a Biſhop and a Paſtor of the Church. Otherwiſe if he would not lend an Ear to their juſt complaints, they proteſted their innocence of all the misfortunes that ſhould fall upon his Highneſs and the Country. This Letter was dated the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> 1657.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop anſwered fully, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other thoughts than to preſerve his ſubjects in repoſe with the care and fidelity of a Father. That he always was for Peace and Union, but the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> by its obſtinacy had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not only this, but a far more rigorous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. That he had proceeded no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than a Prince and Soveraign Lord ought to proceed againſt Rebels. If the City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould ſuffer any damage thereby, time would repair it. That the City had rejected the Juſtice of the Imperial Chamber, in regard they had deſired ſuccours from the Hans Towns and the States of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> In concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he deſired the Nobility to aſſiſt him as their Prince, to reduce a Rebellious City to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Biſhop endeavour'd by all manner of means to do what miſchief he could to the City. Night and day he play'd with his great Guns, and ſent in his Bombs and Fire-Balls which did great Execution. Which ſo heighten'd the indignation of the Townſmen againſt the Biſhop, that becauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101014:16"/> they would not forget the year wherein their houſes had been ſo ill handl'd by Fire, they caus'd new Colours to be made with theſe words <hi>GaLen InCenDIt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbeM,</hi> The numeral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whereof are M. DC. LVII. With theſe Colours they march'd about their Streets, and theſe Enſigns they flouriſh'd upon their Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks. As for their Biſhop they gave him no other Title than that of <hi>Murderer,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of their City. The women themſelves, at other times mild and tender hearted, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Husbands againſt him, as an Oppreſſor and a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Pope ſent a Letter to the Biſhop which did not very well pleaſe him. For that therein he adviz'd him to forbear all farther acts of Hoſtility againſt the City, or otherwiſe he threaten'd to Excommunicate him. The Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> wrote to him alſo to the ſame effect, but in vain, for he ſtill purſu'd his deſign.</p>
            <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>September</hi> the Bombs caus'd a terrible Fire at <hi>Munſter,</hi> which laſted from Midnight till Morning. Of all the former Fires this was the moſt lamentable. After which the Biſhop made a propoſition to the City, to receive a Garriſon of a thouſand men, and to Caſhier their Commander <hi>Wittenburg;</hi> upon which conditions they might have Peace. But they by no means would give their conſent.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101014:16"/>
            <p>The three Electors <hi>Treves, Mayence</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn,</hi> exhorted the City to ſubmiſſion; but all to no purpoſe. The Citizens exaſperated would not be reappeas'd. The Commonalty encourag'd one the other, and lifting up their hands, cry'd aloud. <hi>Be of good Courage</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>be of good Courage, the</hi> Hollanders <hi>are coming to thy aſſiſtance.</hi> For the States General had ſent them ſome ſuccor. Nevertheleſs they were much endammag'd by the Bombs and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's. Two Churches, and above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Houſes were already reduced to Aſhes. Afterward the Biſhop made a general Aſſault, but was repuls'd with loſs. The ſeventeenth of <hi>October</hi> a Truce was made for four days. Which ſo enraged the Citizens, that they openly revil'd the Council, and were within a little of laying violent hands upon them.</p>
            <p>All this while the Deputies of the Chapter of the Cathedral, of the Nobility and the Town did all that lay in their power; ſo that at length an agreement was made the twenty firſt of the ſaid Month. That no perſon ſhould be call'd to accompt for the troubles paſt, neither in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> nor without the City, nor ſuffer either in Body or Eſtate. That the Priſoners on both ſides ſhould be releas'd. That the Council of the City ſhould retain in their ſervice three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, and admit of five hundred <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> as alſo the ordinary Guards of the Biſhops Body, both Horſe and Foot. That their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101014:17"/> ſhould take an Oath, not to act any thing contrary to the Priviledges of the City. That when the Biſhop was in the City, he ſhould give the Watch-word, and in his abſence, that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens Council ſhould appoint it. That, in regard the Diſpute about the Keys was before the Imperial Chamber, the iſſue of their ſentence ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. In the mean time, that the Citizens and Council ſhould open the Gates of the City to the Biſhop at all times, when by him requir'd, or thought convenient, and that they ſhould give him all the honor and reſpect due to his Perſon and Quality. On the other ſide the Biſhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to preſerve the Priviledges of the City, and the Burgomaſters and Council promiſe to keep their Oaths inviolably.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop would not have conſented to Conditions ſo favourable, had not the forces of the States General been upon their march for the relief of the City. They conſiſted of forty five Troops of Horſe, and ninety ſeven Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot. This Army made an alteration in the Biſhops thoughts, who in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> made his Entry into the City. He was receiv'd as became him, by the Council. The Townſmen were in Arms all along the ſtreets as he paſs'd. But not a perſon would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him, as he rode in his Coach, nor give him thoſe Volleys of honour which are cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary: their outward behaviour being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to the inward thoughts of their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101014:17"/> hearts. And this was the end of the Siege. Of the beſieged about fourſcore were ſlain; but the Biſhop loſt above two thouſand. This was alſo the ſecond agreement between the Biſhop and the City concluded in 1657. The former being made in the Year 1655.</p>
            <p>Though the Peace were concluded, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſtill retain'd in his ſervice ſeveral Troops and Regiments; and he enter'd into Alliances with other Princes, without the knowledg and conſent of the Eſtates, and by conſequence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their confirm'd Priviledges. Which caus'd both ſuſpition and hatred; ſo that there was no good intelligence between the City and the Biſhop. The Burgomaſters miſtruſted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and the Biſhop had no affection for them. This was the occaſion of new differences which increas'd from day to day; from whence might eaſily be diſcover'd the flames of a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching War. Whereupon the City ſent their Deputies to the States of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> who return'd with a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>About this time a report was divulg'd over all <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> that the <hi>Munſterians</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to admit the public exerciſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion into their City to oblige the States General. But the Council publiſh'd an Edict, wherein they declared this report to be a meer Invention. And thus things paſs'd on, till the Year 1660. at what time the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101014:18"/> flames of a new War burſt forth again.</p>
            <p>By the Treaty in the Year 1657. It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the old and new differences between the two parties, lying before the Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Spiers,</hi> ſhould remain as they were. At length the Chamber came to a Final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to this purpoſe, that ſince the City could not ſufficiently prove their rights pretended in reference to the Garriſon, that the Keys, Walls, Gates, Bulwarks and Watch-word ſhould be at the diſpoſal of the Biſhop as their Prince. The Burgomaſters and Counſellors were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfi'd at the ſentence, and crav'd a rehearing. On the other ſide the Biſhop complain'd, that they refus'd to ſubmit to the ſentence of the Chamber, and demanded <hi>Mandate of Execution,</hi> which was granted him, if the City at the end of two months did not fairly comply. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then that they did not ſubmit, but ſought for Foreign aſſiſtance, upon the tenth of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1660. the Council receiv'd an Order Imperial that they ſhould recal their Deputies out of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and cancel whatever had been treated upon, under penalty of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Neither had they above two months time to ſhew their ſubmiſſion to the Chamber, and their promiſe of amendment and obedience for the future. And this affair the Biſhop manag'd ſo well that all things went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wiſh.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101014:18"/>
            <p>The City truſted in the ſuccours that were promis'd them by the States General, who had aſſur'd them of aſſiſtance, in purſuance of the League made with the Hanſe Towns, wherein <hi>Munſter</hi> was compriz'd. So that at the ſame time the States ſent a Letter to the Biſhop, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him that he would either purſue his action at Law, or make a fair agreement, leſt they ſhould be forc'd to concern themſelves in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, a little while after the <hi>Munſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> ſent Orders to their Deputies at the <hi>Hague</hi> to return home and deſiſt from Treating any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This was after the Imperial Command.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop made great complaints againſt the City at the Emperors Court, ſharply accuſing them of diſobedience to the Emperors Orders: withal requeſting that the Emperors Orders might be put in Execution. The Council wrote to the Emperor that they had obey'd, and had Commanded their Deputies home from the <hi>Hague,</hi> upon which their being Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated was put off. Thereupon the Biſhop, not being able any longer to curb his unquiet humor, began to block up the City with his Forces. The Emperor ſent to let him know, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he ſhould deſiſt from all Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and permit the City a free Trade.

So that <hi>Munſter</hi> was now left to itſelf, not a little complaining againſt the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>The twenty firſt of <hi>Jan. Bernard Zimmerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheyd,</hi> the Burgomaſter with ſix others of the Council, ventured out of Town to the Quarters of the Biſhop, where they were heard by two of the Biſhops Counſellers. They implor'd his Highneſſes favour toward the miſerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City, and beſought him for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101014:19"/> love of God that they might be admitted into his preſence to underſtand his reſolutions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the queſtion was put to them, whether they did not acknowledg in the preſence of God that they were Rebels. The Burgomaſter, ſhrugging his ſhoulders, excuſed the Magiſtracy ſo far, that it was not in their power to curb the violent humour of the Populacy. To which he was anſwer'd in this language. Obey then the Emperors Commands, disband your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, bring the Keys of the City to your Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, and receive his Garriſons, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe your Prince will teach you with a far more numerous force to reverence and obey your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
            <p>Thereupon in regard there was no Corn left in the City, nor no mony to pay the Souldiers who were already two months in arrears, there was a neceſſity of ſubmitting to whatever the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop required; which brought them to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſurrender the 18. of <hi>March</hi> upon theſe conditions. That the Gates ſhould be guarded by the Epiſcopal Troops; that the Citizens ſhould refuſe the aſſiſtance of the States General and of all others. That they ſhould pay the Biſhop at preſent 40000. Crowns, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Annual tribute of 7. or 8000. Crowns, upon which conſideration they ſhould have their pardons. That ſix perſons ſhould be excluded from this pardon, who were nevertheleſs to be free from Corporal puniſhment or life. That
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101014:20"/> they ſhould receive an Epiſcopal Garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation. That they ſhould ſurrender the Keys to the Biſhop; and that whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the ſecurity of the City ſhould be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at the Biſhops diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>Scon after, in a great deal of haſt he began the foundation of a Citadel, call'd <hi>Munſters Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</hi> He regulated all the Colledges and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhips of the City, and ſet up a new form of Government, which began to require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt from ſome part of thoſe who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born Offices. Four Receivers were put in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon pretence of having falſified their Truſt. One of the Counſellers, excluded from pardon, was conſtrained to pay the Biſhop 2000. Crowns, and an Antient Burgomaſter as much; after which they were both baniſhed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Thus Prince <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard</hi> reduc'd the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> under his ſubjection. And now he might have liv'd in quiet, had not his boiſtrous and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſet on foot an old diſpute, and publiſh'd a writing concerning the conteſt about <hi>Borculo;</hi> in reference to which affair it was by him alledg'd, that the Imperial Council of <hi>Spiers</hi> had given ſentence in ſavour of the Biſhop, declaring that that <hi>Signory</hi> was a Fee belonging to <hi>Munſter,</hi> and by conſequence eſcheated to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101014:20"/> him. In oppoſition to this the Count of <hi>Stirum</hi> had the Decree of the Court of <hi>Guelders,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in poſſeſſion, who thereupon, a while after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caus'd an anſwer to the Biſhops cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in writing. This was done in the year 1662. The year following the Biſhop ſent Monſieur <hi>Braybeck,</hi> Dean of the Cathedral of <hi>Munſter,</hi> as his Embaſſadour, to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he attended the States General with a Memorial, deſiring them in the name of his Prince, that they would favour his juſt demands, and reſtore to him the Signory of <hi>Porculo</hi> and its dependencies, which the Arms of the States had put into the poſſeſſion of Count <hi>Juſtus of Limburg,</hi> in regard it was done by the Province of <hi>Guelders</hi> in the Year 1616. Moniſeur <hi>De Eſtrades</hi> alſo, the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable to the Biſhop, and ſmartly put the States in mind of having a reſpect to Juſtice and the Alliance between his Maſter and the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>The Deputies of <hi>Guelders</hi> affirm'd that they took the buſineſs upon themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> However cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commiſſioners were nam'd, but nothing more done that Year Next Year, Monſieur <hi>Bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> preſs'd the ſame demand again. For which reaſon the States General would have order'd certain other Commiſſioners to enquire into the affair. But the Province of <hi>Guelders</hi> would by no means conſent thereto, becauſe they had paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d ſentence already; as alſo for that the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory of <hi>Borculo</hi> belonged to their Province, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101014:21"/> by conſequence the buſineſs concern'd them in particular, and not the Generality.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Prince of <hi>Lichtenſtien</hi> had laid claim to a certain debt which he charg'd upon the Signiories of <hi>Eſens, Stedeſdorp</hi> and <hi>Witmond,</hi> which his Mother-in-law had enjoy'd by the death of her Brother-in-law. This debt was demanded from the Prince of <hi>Eaſt-Frieſland,</hi> who was by the Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber condemn'd to pay it. The Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> altogether for having his Oar in every Boat, had ſo brought it about, that the Emperor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him a Commiſſion to put the Imperial ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Execution. In the mean time he labour'd to make the beſt uſe of the Opportunity, and to bring his matters about to his chiefeſt advantage.</p>
            <p>To this effect, he ſo wrought it, that theſe two powerful Neighbours the Prince and he, under a pretence of hunting the Wild-Boar, ſhould meet together in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> in <hi>Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1663. The Biſhop was very urgent with the Prince to deliver him up <hi>Eyderland</hi> promiſing in lieu ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101014:21"/> that the ſaid <hi>Eyderland</hi> was under the protection of the States General, and engaged for a certain ſum of mony. So that no ſuch thing could be done, as well in reſpect of his Brother, as in reſpect of the States, who had a ſhare and intereſt in this affair. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he took time to conſider of it, as a thing that requir'd a more thoughtful deliberation.</p>
            <p>Six days after the Biſhop ſent Monſieur <hi>John Schuylemburg,</hi> who was fled from <hi>Groningen,</hi> to the Prince to perſuade him with all his might to give him the the poſſeſſion of <hi>Eyderland.</hi> The Magiſtrates of <hi>Groningen</hi> had ſudden intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence thereof, and gave preſent Order to the Commander of the Fort of <hi>Langueracker</hi> to ſeize upon <hi>Schuylemburgh</hi> with a party of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers; but he having ſecret notice thereof, eſcap'd in a Country mans Cart to <hi>Aurick;</hi> where he ſhew'd his Orders to the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> whom he very zealouſly urg'd to the ſame ſurrender but had from him a generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal.

            <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Munſter</hi> aſſur'd the Prince that if theſe Conditions were obſerv'd he would ſtay the Execution which he had a Commiſſion to make; which was put into writing and ſign'd by both ſides. The firſt time was hardly elaps'd, when the Prince deſir'd ſome little longer time. But the Biſhop unwilling to let ſlip the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, immediately diſpatch'd away ſome Forces from <hi>Munſter</hi> to <hi>Eyderſconce,</hi> belonging to the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> to begin the ſaid Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. There were not above eight or nine men in the Fort at that time, becauſe the Prince expected no ſuch ſudden Attacque, ſo that the Epiſcoparians ſuddainly made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the place. <hi>Elverfield,</hi> whom the Biſhop ſent upon this exploit; was more wary in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it afterwards, refortifying it, and ſtoring it with all manner of Warlike Proviſion and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>When the News of the ſurpriſe of <hi>Eyder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconce</hi> was brought to the <hi>Hague,</hi> they preſently adjudg'd the Biſhops manner of proceeding irregular, and unhandſomly carry'd, in regar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

More than that, they reſolv'd to raiſe a conſiderable Force to employ, as they ſhould ſee cauſe, if the Biſhop refus'd to reſtore the Fort upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt mony.</p>
            <p>Nor could the States be blam'd for intereſting themſelves in this affair. For beſides that they were oblig'd to take into their Protection the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Freeſland;</hi> they had juſt reaſon to ſuſpect a Prince, who was of ſuch a turbulent humor as to ſeek all occaſions of quarrelling, and ſought nothing more than to neſtle himſelf upon their Frontiers with a Foreign Militia; a Prince who demanded from them <hi>Borculo</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and a Prince who was not a little ſupported by <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Forces therefore being rais'd were committed to the charge of Prince <hi>William Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Governour of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Ninety nine Companies of Horſe and Foot, in all 4971. men.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the States us'd all their endeavour during the Winter, to free the <hi>Sconce</hi> without the effuſion of blood. To this purpoſe they writ to the Biſhop and the Prince of <hi>Lichten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> offering their mediation; they deſir'd them to ſend their Plenipotentiaries to <hi>Lierwert,</hi> as they would alſo theirs. They profeſs'd to pay the firſt upon quitting the <hi>Sconce:</hi> but they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101014:23"/> could have no anſwer. On the other ſide <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> the Governour, ſent to all the Bayliffs and Receivers of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> within a months time to bring with them the Regiſters of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and charging them withal not to pay any mony, but to ſuch Receiver as either the Biſhop or the Prince of <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that they could not perſuade the Biſhop by fair means, the States General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to go on with their deſigns. However they writ firſt to the Biſhop, to give him notice of their intentions, letting him know that they were oblig'd to protect the Prince of <hi>Eaſt-Frieſland,</hi> and his Country againſt all manner of violence; and at the ſame time offer'd ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for <hi>Lichtenſteins</hi> debt. At laſt they adviz'd him before the tenth of <hi>May</hi> to quit the Fort and Country, or that they ſhould be forc'd to make uſe of ſuch means as God ſhould direct them.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop anſwer'd, That he had always made it his buſineſs to live in a good Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence and Amity with the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces;</hi> that he had not been ſevere with the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> but had given him his own time; and therefore the States General had no ſuch reaſon to uſe ſuch threatning language.</p>
            <p>While this Letter was upon the Road the States Forces were marching from their ſeveral Garriſons to the General Rendeſvouz. In the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101014:23"/> mean while M. <hi>Brabeck</hi> came from the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to the <hi>Hague</hi> to make an accord: and all things ſeem'd to look with a fair proſpect. The Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland</hi> was ready to pay. The Biſhop or the Prince of <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> were ready to receive the mony; ſo that there was no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute but only about the quitting the Fort. At length an agreement was made the 25. of <hi>May.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland</hi> was to cauſe 270000 Crowns to be pay'd at <hi>Meppel</hi> for the firſt and ſecond payment; as alſo 150000 Crowns for Intereſt. The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was to give an acquittance, and the fifth of <hi>June</hi> he was to begin to quit the Fort, that is to ſay, the next day after the payment of the mony.</p>
            <p>Men thought that now every thing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon. So that Order was given to Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſan</hi> to forbear any acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt the Fort, which was already Beſieg'd, and reduc'd almoſt to the laſt extremity. The 31. of <hi>May,</hi> New Stile, being the laſt day of the Truce, and the time appointed for the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries of <hi>Munſter</hi> to be at Prince <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>'s Quarters with the confirmation of the League, four or five perſons accompany'd with one Horſe man paſs'd from the Prince of <hi>Tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt</hi>'s Quarters, who was General of the States Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>Stapelmer,</hi> which was Prince <hi>Williams</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Among theſe were two Embaſſadours from the Biſhop. The States Deputies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101014:24"/> it, went to them: but they told them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Complements, that they were ſent by their Prince to Treat with the Plenipotentiaries of the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> to whom they were going with that intent. The States De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties made anſwer, that they hop'd they had Orders to Treat with them alſo, as being the States Deputies in the Army, but they made them the ſame cold and careleſs anſwer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Now in regard it was five hours after the Concluſion of the Truce, and for that the States Deputies were altogether ignorant of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſo ſtrange a proceeding; and had reaſon to doubt whether they were the Biſhops Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or no, ſince they would not declare who they were; beſides if they had that abſolute power, that it ought to be examin'd and known; it was thought fit to continue the Attacque, as they did the next day. So that the Fort was batter'd from ſix batteries with ſixteen pieces of Canon, ſeveral Granado's were alſo caſt into it, which did good Execution.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Biſhops Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries got to the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> and produc'd the accquittance. But all very ill drawn, and which gave no ſatisfaction. The Embaſſadours of <hi>Munſter</hi> alſo publickly declar'd that their Lord and Biſhop could not ſtand to the accord as it was worded in wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing. So that it being then impoſſible to diſcover his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101014:24"/> ſigns, the Siege was carry'd on with greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the Beſieg'd were forc'd to ſurrender upon Articles the fourth of <hi>June;</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the States Garriſon.</p>
            <p>Several of the Neighbouring Princes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe proceedings, had no good wiſhes for the Biſhop, as being a plague both to his Neighbours and his Subjects. The Princes of <hi>Brunſwick, Wirtenbergh,</hi> and <hi>Heſſen</hi> diſapprov'd his proceedings, as being a very unjuſt thing to proſecute an Execution, or to remain in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Lands Mortgag'd, when payment was offer'd upon juſt acquittances. They were more glad to ſee the <hi>Eyder Sconce</hi> taken by force, than that it ſhould have been quitted by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to the end the Biſhops wings might be in ſome meaſure clipt. For ſuch an Execution had not been made in ſeveral Ages; And ſhould it come to be uſed, none of the Neighbours could hence forward be ſecure, ſince few Princes were to be found without teeth.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this War, which was but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another that follow'd, far more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The turbulent Biſhop, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been in Action againſt the Prince of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland,</hi> the Count of <hi>Bentheim,</hi> the Count of <hi>Styrum,</hi> the Count of <hi>Floderf</hi> and others, ſtudy'd to make uſe of the firſt opportunity to aſſault and revenge himſelf upon the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But it behoov'd him to ſtay till ſome other Prince, more potent than himſelf, ſhould think
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101014:25"/> it convenient to make uſe of him: An oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that ſoon preſented itſelf. For the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being then engaged with <hi>Dutch</hi> in a bloody War, and prudently deſigning to find them work by Land, as well as by Sea, make agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that purpoſe with the Biſhop, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him with mony. Who thereupon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately began his Levies and rais'd a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army, both of Horſe and Foot. It was not known where the ſtorm would fall; So that <hi>Eaſt Frieſland, Oldenburgh,</hi> and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes were much concern'd. The States General and their ſubjects were no leſs ſtartl'd in regard of the great preparation which the Biſhop made of Bombs, Granados and other Fire-works.</p>
            <p>The States had moſt reaſon to be jealous that the ſtorm would light upon their heads. And therefore they Levy'd an Army of 4500 Horſe, and 40500 Foot, of which 5600 were deſign'd for the Sea. It was alſo neceſſary that the Forts ſhould be provided, and therefore becauſe thoſe Forces were not ſufficient, they reſolv'd to take into their ſervice ſome of the <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. They alſo advertiſed the King of <hi>France</hi> of the Biſhops preparations, propoſing at the ſame time whether it were not convenient to prevent the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and ſend a flying Army into his own Country, and to carry the heat of the War thither, rather than to ſuffer him to enter the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> But the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101014:25"/> King of <hi>France</hi> did not like that propoſition, judging it more proper to ſtay and obſerve which way the Biſhop would move. For otherwiſe the whole Empire would be in an uproar, if they ſhould attacque the Biſhop firſt. The <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>has Enemies enow; and therefore it is not good for them to awake ſleeping Lyons. The Biſhop is of no ſuch importance, but that it will be eaſie to put a ſtop to him. And therefore it will be better to abide his ſmall power, than all the Force of the Empire.</hi> This Counſel was approv'd and follow'd.</p>
            <p>At length a Trumpet arriv'd at the <hi>Hague</hi> from the Biſhop, with a Letter to the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; which was indeed no more than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of War. He firſt complain'd of the affront and dammages which he had receiv'd, which oblig'd him to demand ſatisfaction; and to ſecure himſelf for the future. To which end he plac'd his refuge in God, and the ſuccours of the Potent Princes his Allies, which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God had rais'd him. That the States General had nothing to do to meddle with the Execution of the Sentences of the Empire. That they had fallen upon his Country contrary to all Equity. That they had plunder'd the Houſes of his Nobility. That they had depriv'd the Husbandman of his labour; they had tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, beaten, roſted his ſubjects; they had not ſpar'd God himſelf; they had handl'd the Croſs of Chriſt worſe than the <hi>Turks</hi> would have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101014:26"/> done; burnt his Churches, diſhonour'd the Sacred Hoſt, and taken <hi>Eyder Sconce</hi> from him in deſpite of the whole Empire, regarding more their own intereſt than the advantage of <hi>Eaſt Frieſland:</hi> all which he was then forc'd to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, having ſent a part of his Troops to aſſiſt the Emperour againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> That they detain'd from him his Signiory of <hi>Borculo;</hi> and moreover, that the Court of <hi>Guelders</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him in the ſum of 150000 Livres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They had taken, and put to the rack ſevera <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> out of a hatred to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

            </p>
            <p>The States made anſwer that they had never made War upon him in his own Country; only that they had been conſtrain'd the laſt year, wher he enter'd their Territories, and took from then the Fort of <hi>Eyder Sconce,</hi> to repel Force wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101014:26"/> pretence to colour his deſigns. However if any ſuch dammage had happen'd, he ought to have demanded ſatisfaction at the time when the crimes were committed, and not eight or ten months after. And therefore the States might with more juſtice require ſatisfaction from him, ſince he had put them to ſuch vaſt charges for the retaking of <hi>Eyder Sconce,</hi> which was engag'd to them: which when they had done, they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd no farther with him. That they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at his demand of <hi>Borculo,</hi> as a Signiory which they detain'd from him: When it was well known that that diſpute had been ended, not by Judges intereſted, but by ſuch as had been choſen by both parties. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the buſineſs of the 150000 Crowns, which he ow'd to the Count of <hi>Styrum,</hi> brought to determination. That it had been always their deſire to live in Peace and Friendſhip with him, but ſince he had attacqu'd their Forts and Places of ſtrength, and had begun to harraſs their Territories, they would not neglect any means, that God ſhould afford them, to bring him to reaſon, till they had receiv'd full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the dammages which they had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd.</p>

            <p>As for the Biſhop of <hi>Munſters</hi> Forces they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all ſort of outrages imaginable: For in regard he ſeldom paid his Souldiers, but left them to ſubſiſt upon Contributions and Plunder, every one pillag'd and rob'd for himſelf. The Emperor offer'd his Mediation to the States to reconcile the difference; but they anſwer'd that they could not enter into a Treaty till the Biſhop had quitted all the places which he had taken. They alſo wrote to the States of <hi>Munſter</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Biſhop to reſtrain his men from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe murders, and acts of violence and cruelty, in that barbarous and unheard of manner, and to quit the places which he had taken, or otherwiſe that they ſhould be ſound to proceed againſt them both in general and in particular according to the common Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of War.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Biſhop had ſent a part of his Forces into the Province of <hi>Groning.</hi> They march'd over the <hi>Moor</hi> or the <hi>Bourlang</hi> to the Convent of <hi>Ter Apellel,</hi> and made themſelves Maſters of it.

            <p>The moſt part of the Biſhops Army caus'd a continual fear all along the <hi>Yſſel.</hi> The Biſhop himſelf lay at <hi>Deuteron,</hi> where he caus'd the Country people of <hi>Troent</hi> and other Places to acknowledg him for their Sovereign and to come to an agreement with him, that two thirds of the Crop ſhould belong to him; and one to the Husband man. Here the reproach which the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> caſt in his teeth, in the name of his Maſter the King of <hi>France,</hi> was a a ſharp one, <hi>That though he were an Eccleſiaſtical Lord, he had falſifi'd his Faith, ſince he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to</hi> France, <hi>not to enterprize any thing againſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101014:28"/> the</hi> Low-Countries <hi>without his Maſters knowledg, which promiſe he had ignominiouſly broken.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd aſſiſtance at the Diet at <hi>Regensbergh.</hi> But it was anſwer'd him, that he had undertaken that War of his own head, without any provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and therefore even let him end it of himſelf. The Empire did not think it convenient to meddle with needleſs and unprofitable Quarrels. If he had brought his affairs into confuſion, his beſt way would be to quit himſelf as well as he could. Several of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, repair'd every day out of <hi>Holland</hi> to the Biſhop, ſome out of hopes of booty, others to aſſiſt him and to exterminate thoſe that they call'd Hereticks, and with an intention to ſpread the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereupon the States iſſu'd forth a publick Placaet, that they ſhould return again within fifteen days upon pain of death or perpetual Baniſhment.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop being repuls'd in the Province of <hi>Groningen,</hi> harraſs'd and ruin'd all the Villages that could not defend themſelves. His Troops that had been in <hi>Wiſchoten,</hi> and <hi>Heyliguerlee,</hi> for want of Proviſion, were retreated into the Country of <hi>Weſtwoldinger</hi> while the States Troops retook <hi>Lochum.</hi> After that the Army of the States increaſing and the <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> Troops approaching, the States of <hi>Munſter</hi> began to fear being overlay'd on the one ſide by the States Forces, while the <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> aſſail'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101014:29"/> them on the other; and therefore ſent their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the Biſhop, and the Biſhops Counſellers themſelves repreſented to the Biſhop the danger he was in, deſiring him to think of Peace. But he made them anſwer either in his ſury or elſe in his deſpair. <hi>He would hazard all</hi> Weſtphalia <hi>in this enterprize. Let the worſt come to the worſt, he had nothing to loſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The States had a deſign to viſit the Biſhop in his own Country; for which purpoſe they had already 17000. men upon the march: but the fierce cold of the Winter then approaching ſtopp'd their progreſs, ſo that the Souldiers were forc'd to retire into their Garriſons. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Troops alſo quitted the field, after they had offer'd Battel to the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Between <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Enſchede</hi> they attacqu'd 1200 Horſe and Foot, who were ſent to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Caſtle of <hi>Wickelen,</hi> and put them to a conſiderable defeat: and thus ended the Year 1665.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time ſome attacques were made by parties of both ſides, but of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, till at laſt a Peace was concluded in <hi>April,</hi> upon ſeveral conditions, The chief of which were, That there ſhould be an Act of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity for all, except Traitors. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould quit all places which he had taken during the War. That he ſhould withdraw his Forces out of all the Territories of the States Dominions. That the Biſhop ſhould disband his Troops after the Ratification on both ſides, and ſhould retain no more than what the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators ſhould determine to be ſufficient for his Garriſons, which was 3000 Horſe and Foot, and that he ſhould not raiſe any new Levies unleſs it were for the ſecurity of the Empire, or of his Alliances, provided alſo they were not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to this Treaty. That the Biſhop ſhould quit all Alliances prejudicial to this Peace, and never make any new War againſt the <hi>Republick.</hi> The States for their parts oblige themſelves to perform the ſame promiſes on their parts. That the Biſhop ſhall quit his pretences to the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of <hi>Borculo</hi> and its dependencies, without prejudice to the rights of the Empire. That neither the Biſhop, nor his ſucceſſors nor his ſubjects ſhould intermeddle with any affairs that concern the States General. That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101014:30"/> the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Electors of <hi>Mayence, Treves, Cologne</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Paderborn, Pal, Nieubergh,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> ſhall be Cautionaries for the obſervation of theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>This was the ſudden concluſion of this War ſo ſuddenly enter'd into. The confirmation and publication whereof was made by the Biſhop the 20. of <hi>April,</hi> with theſe words. <hi>Promiſing to obſerve and inviolably to follow in all points and clauſes the ſaid Inſtrument, and not to ſuffer any proceeding or act to be done againſt the ſaid Articles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But within a few years after it appear'd how well he kept his word.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop had alſo ſought to pick a quarrel with <hi>George William</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> concerning the Office of <hi>Herbſtad,</hi> and other things. As alſo againſt <hi>Erneſt Auguſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburgh,</hi> touching the City of <hi>Hoxter.</hi> But theſe things were alſo adjuſted in the Treaty with the States: ſo that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was conſtrain'd to quit his unjuſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>The time agreed upon for the Biſhop to quit thoſe places which belonged to the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being come, the Biſhop rais'd ſtill ſome new Cavils firſt in regard of the Priſoners, and then as to the Contributions; touching the quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſome particular places; concerning <hi>Eaſt-Frieſland;</hi> and as to ſome dammages which he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101014:30"/> had ſuſtain'd. This was the occaſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meeting at <hi>Noordhorn</hi> in the Country of <hi>Benthem,</hi> and another Treaty in the month of <hi>June.</hi> He evaded after a ſtrange manner ſome words of the Peace: by which it appeard that it was ſorely againſt his will, that he quitted <hi>Borculo,</hi> for he kept that place as long as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could. And being preſs'd to performance by M. <hi>Syburg</hi> the States Envoy, he cry'd out, <hi>My City of</hi> Borculo; <hi>my City of</hi> Borculo, <hi>that belongs to me both by the Law of God and men!</hi> Than after a ſhort ſinlence, he added, <hi>I will take care that it be quitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the concluſion of this Peace the States recall'd to mind the inconveniencies they had ſuffer'd upon the Frontiers of the <hi>Spaniſh Low-Countries,</hi> not only from the <hi>Munſterians,</hi> but alſo ſecretly from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Munſterians.</hi> For that reaſon they reſolv'd to make their complaints at the Court of <hi>Madrid</hi> and to demand ſatisfaction by M. <hi>Rensmoude</hi> then their Ambaſſadour in <hi>Spain.</hi> To which purpoſe they ſend him a Letter to this effect for his Information.</p>
            <p>At what time the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to a attacque this Common-wealth, he was known to have made publick Levies at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Lovain, Anwerp, Gaunt, Bructelſt, Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Santvliet, Lier, Gueel</hi> and other parts.

            <p>In the ſaid places they had form'd deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſeveral of the moſt important Frontier Cities and Garriſons belonging to the States, of <hi>Breda, Clundert, Willemſtad, Lillo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of theſe and ſeveral other vaſt injuries and dammages they had often complain'd, but could never obtain ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more complaints the States order'd their Ambaſſadour to exhibit to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which the ſlow <hi>Spaniard</hi> had not time to give an anſwer this Year. So that the ſo long talkt of Year 1666. made its exit with no other advantage to the <hi>Hollander</hi> than the Peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi> But in the Year 1667. that unquiet man of God began again to make conſiderable Levies both of Horſe and Foot. The <hi>States General</hi> having intelligence thereof, and no way confiding in him, wrote him a Letter, to let him know, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orary to the ſeventh Article of the Treaty, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly requeſting him to deſiſt and not to give his neighbours juſt occaſion of jealouſies and ſuſpicions. Thereupon he return'd the <hi>States</hi> this anſwer, That when he had made a Peace, it was his care to keep it. But conſidering the great Levies made by his Neighbours, he could not but think it convenient to raiſe ſo many men, as were allow'd him by the Conſtitutions of the Empire, the Inſtructions of the Peace, and the priviledg of Princes. However that he had no deſign to employ them, but only for the ſecurity
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101014:32"/> of his own Country, and no way to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Neighbours, more eſpecially of their Lordſhips the States General. What ſhould they do? For they then knew not how to rely upon the words or proteſtations of the Biſhop, yet they could do no other than ſeem to be ſatisfied with his Apology.</p>
            <p>The ſame Year he caus'd more diſturbances by chooſing for his Coadjutor <hi>Ferdinand de Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenbergh,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> Prince of the Holy Empire, Count of <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> &amp;c. againſt the conſent of moſt of the members of the Chapter, who would fain have choſen the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologn.</hi> But the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> ſpoyl'd their deſign, by excluding ſome of the members, inveigling others with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and menacing others, and ſo by force advancing the Election of the Biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derborn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to put a ſpecious gloſs upon this Election the Biſhop publiſh'd a large relation thereof, of which we will give the Reader an abſtract; only it muſt be conſider'd, that this was the Biſhops own work, and that therefore he fram'd it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the moſt advantageous manner for himſelf. In the fore-front he places Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſevenths Letter, being a ſerious exhortation to him to take a Coadjutor and a Succeſſor.</p>

The Letters which we have ſent you from time to time, apparently teſtifie how much we are overjoy'd to underſtand with what care you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt yourſelf in the advancement and eſtabliſhing of the Catholick Religion, and that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to your Obedience the Rebellious City of</hi> Munſter. <hi>But in regard that both experience and Hiſtories aſſure us, that the Benediction of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity loſes its glory, when we take no care to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh what we have acquir'd, and do not make uſe of the means which we have learnt to our coſt by the ſame experience, and by which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Religion and Peace may remain inviolable. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks therefore there can be no better means to take away all occaſion of diſputes that may ariſe after your death, by the Election of a Succeſſor, than to think of taking a Coadjutor, to cut off all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of diſcord which may reduce your Country to confuſion and miſery. And therefore we exhort you ſeriouſly to deliberate ſpeedily with your Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning this matter. And if you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, according to the cuſtom of ſome Chapters in</hi> Germany, <hi>not to take a Coadjutor without the knowledg and conſent of the Chapter, we diſcharge you by vertue of this our preſent Letter from any ſuch obligation, and give you withal the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Benediction.</hi>

            <p>There are ſome who have made the following remarques upon this Letter. 1. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, according to the opinion of thoſe who were acquainted with the buſineſs, made it his own requeſt to the Pope for this Letter. 2. That thoſe who are call'd the Vicars of Chriſt are of a different judgment. Pope Innocent the X. would never confirm nor acknowledge for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Elected Biſhop <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard.</hi> But <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. was no ſooner mounted to the Papal Chair, but both Confirmation and Legitimation were allow'd. 3. How it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks ſhould confide in their Princes, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſeeing the Pope can ſo eaſily diſcharge and diſingage them from their Promiſes, Oaths and Allegiances confirm'd and concluded even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop receiv'd this Paternal exhortation with a wonderful reſpect; and in regard he had been acquainted with the diſorders in the laſt Election, he earneſtly deſir'd to make choice of a Coadjutor. To this purpoſe he caus'd the Members of the Chapter to aſſemble the 23. of <hi>May,</hi> where he propos'd his deſign by two of his Counſellers; who in a ſhort ſpeech repreſented
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101014:33"/> to them, that it was not unknown what praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy actions his Highneſs had perform'd in the beginning of his Government, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd and retaken the Forts and Cities of his Country, as <hi>Coeſweld, Veche,</hi> and <hi>Beverguere.</hi> That he had compos'd ſeveral differences with a moſt pious care and zeal; that he had reduc'd the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> to his obedience, and ſo firmly ſettl'd Peace within his Territories, that all his Subjects quietly injoy'd the Eſtates which God had bleſt them with. But ſince his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was now in the Sixtieth year of his Age, and that by conſequence he could not expect to live long; as alſo for that to prevent the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Elections, his Holineſs had adviz'd and exhorted him by his Letters, to take the firſt opportunity to chooſe a Coadjutor and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; He was reſolv'd ſo to do. He knows, ſaid they, that there are perſons capable of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment both here and in other places; but his Highneſs would propoſe no-perſon in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. If they had a mind to chooſe any Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince, or any other Catholick Prince, he would by no means be their hinderance, but leave the Chapter to its liberty. To which he expected a fair anſwer.</p>
            <p>Then the Popes Letter to the Chapter was produc'd as follows.</p>

            <p>This Letter being Read, and the Biſhops A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent withdrawn, the Chapter fell to debate the propoſal. Some of the Canons of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church were of opinion, that the affair was of that importance, that it requir'd a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time to be conſider'd of: and that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ought to be put, whether a Coadjutor were to be choſen? and this too to be conſulted at leiſure. Others thought it more convenient to comply with his Holineſſes Exhortation, and his Highneſſes deſire, who better knew the condition of the Church and Country. Nay they thought they had already neglected too much time in fulfilling the Popes will, who had deſir'd a ſettlement of this affair toward the end of the Year 1665. and that now the Year 1667. was far ſpent, by the intervening of ſeveral accidents, and that by conſequence the buſineſs ought to be no longer delay'd. Thereupon it was carried by the major part of voices, that the 19. of <hi>July,</hi> ſhould be appointed for the Election of a Coadjutor, and that the Letters of Citation ſhould be diſpatch'd, notwithſtanding the <hi>Proteſtations</hi> of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Thus there happen'd a great conteſt between the Members of the Chapter, not ſo much in reference to the Perſon, whom they intended to chooſe; but whether they ought to admit of a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101014:35"/> Coadjutor or no. As for the Proteſtations of ſeveral, they were little regarded. Others ſay, that the Biſhop had pack'd the voices under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hand; and that he had gain'd to his party ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:101014:35"/> inequality of the voices, to which he added his own, and pronounc'd Sentence, that the Eſcutcheons ſhould be hung up, though the reſt that oppos'd it had at leaſt as many voices as the Dean, according to the Epiſcopal Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſo order'd it, that not only the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheons were not hung up, but alſo took away the Deans vote, that theirs might be the more effectual. And for ſo doing, they urg'd, That they had permitted him to be Dean for ſo many years upon ſufferance, whereas he was no Prieſt, which the Dean ought to be, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that by vertue of that obſtacle, he was to have no voice in the Chapter, according to the Canon Law, yet he had always given his voice in all things. But now they from whom he had taken the plurality of voices, by his ſecond vote, being no longer ſatisfi'd, had taken from him the priviledg of voting, till he had ſhew'd the Biſhop his admiſſion into the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Beſide that they had ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Tranſlation of the Arch-Biſhops Canonſhip upon <hi>Erneſt Leopold de Bockenford,</hi> and therefore they publickly proteſted as well againſt his reception, as againſt the hanging up of his Eſcutcheon; though it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unanimouſly conſented to, becauſe, at that time, there was no obſtacle to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:101014:36"/>
            <p>Others relate this affair quite after another manner than the <hi>Epiſcopal Narrative.</hi> That is to ſay, that the Biſhop would not have the three new Canons receiv'd by thoſe whom he had packt, becauſe they ſhould not act againſt them in the buſineſs of their Eſcutcheons. And that they had excluded the Dean, becauſe they knew he would not be a party in their Cabals. That for the ſame reaſon alſo he was to lay aſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of whom he had hitherto taken no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, notwithſtanding that their ſentiments and actions were then as well known as now. That they themſelves who now refus'd the Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the other perſons, had a hundred times ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited them for their voices upon other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and without any oppoſition, had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd them for lawful. That the Biſhop by this and his conſequent Actions would bring it to paſs, that thoſe who did not exactly approve his deſigns, ſhould oppoſe him on purpoſe, that he might thereby take an occaſion wholly to exclude them.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the Members of the Chapter (that is to ſay, they who had excluded the ſaid perſons) were jealous leſt the Dean, as alſo the Vicar Baron of <hi>Bucholtz</hi> ſhould find a way to make any farther interruption, either by giving their voices illegally or by any other means, they requeſted his Highneſs to ſtand by the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which he had taken, by all manner of expedient means, and to forbid the Dean upon a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101014:36"/> penalty to give his voice any more; that the errors already committed might not ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any farther. Now becauſe the Biſhop could not refuſe this requeſt, as well for that the fact was apparent, as alſo that he might not ſeem to neglect Juſtice and the Holy Canons, he commanded the Dean in writing, to forbear giving his voice in the Chapter, till he had made himſelf out to be a Prieſt. This ſame Dean was M. <hi>Jodocus Etman de Brabeck,</hi> whom the Biſhop had formerly employ'd to the States General to demand the Signiory of <hi>Borculo,</hi> and upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Affairs. Beſides that, he excus'd the Dean from his Employment, as being accus'd by a part of the Members of the Chapter, for having acted againſt ſome Eccleſiaſtical Laws in the Tranſlation of Prebends, &amp;c. Which ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould continue, till ſuch time as he had the Popes Abſolution. This he caus'd to be publiſh'd by his Commiſſaries in the uſual place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Eccleſiaſtick Fiſcal had made an exact ſearch into the lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of thoſe Gentlemen who had voices in the Chapter, knowing that the Sacred Canons excluded all from the Election who were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable. And thereupon, a certain Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Perſon was accus'd before his Highneſs, for having publickly kept a Concubine four and twenty years, and for having to do with ſeveral other women, to the great ſcandal of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101014:37"/> and people; Beſides that in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Arch-Deaconry, he had aſſum'd to himſelf a greater Authority than the Pope, diſpenſing, with an unſufferable arrogance, with ſeveral Marriages in the firſt and ſecond degree, and commanding the Prieſts to finiſh thoſe Marriages which he had concluded Lawful. Which things being known and not puniſh'd by the Dean, therefore they deſir'd, that for his negligence he might be ſuſpended from his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop preſently conſented, and caus'd publication thereof to be made in the uſual place. The ſame misfortune befel two others. Tis true they Appeal'd; but their Appeals were rejected.</p>
            <p>Upon the 16. of <hi>June,</hi> being the ſame day that the Biſhop was to attend the Funerals of the preceding Biſhops of <hi>Munſter,</hi> by eight of the Clock in the Morning came a Publick Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him as he was juſt entred into the Church in his Epicopal Habit, and ready to be attended up to the Quire by the body of the Clergy, and put into his hand a writing from the Dean, to let him know, that though neither in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Oath, nor by vertue of any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was oblig'd to take upon him the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood, of which there were ſeveral Preſidents to be produc'd, not only in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Munſter,</hi> but in ſeveral other places; nevertheleſs that he had receiv'd the Order of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101014:37"/> Deacon the ſecond of <hi>July,</hi> and the <hi>Sunday</hi> following the Order of Prieſthood; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently before the publication of the Decree by which his vote was taken from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was no Prieſt; and this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Copies of two writings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop took them without any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being diſpleas'd at the importunity of the Notary. But he remember'd him for all that the ſame day, to the end he might take it for a warning not to be ſawey another time; telling him withal that he ſhould produce the Originals, becauſe the Copies were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Two days after the Notary came more confidently than before with his witneſſes, and by an unuſual way getting into the Anti-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhew'd himſelf to the Biſhop, then juſt Habited in all his Formalities, and ready to go to hear Divine Service, accompany'd with his Chaplains, Canons and Courtiers. He was ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that he gave the Notary a bloody re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, commanding him from thence forward, not to come any more without leave before Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Quality; or if he had any thing to ſhew him, to give it to his Vicar General. The Notary obey'd, and gave the Originals to the Vicar General, to prove that the Dean was both Deacon and Prieſt. But the Biſhop ſtill found out ſomthing or other to cavil at. As that it was done by another Biſhop, out of ſeaſon,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101014:38"/> without any neceſſity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſide that, he commanded him to prove that he had obſerv'd all thoſe things which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns upon the like occaſions. Thus the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Narration.</hi> Others go further, accuſing the Biſhop not to have done well by the Dean and other perſons, and that by theſe delaies, and denyals to hear their juſtification, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept them in ſuſpenſe, till the Election were paſt, according to his deſire.</p>
            <p>We have told you, that the day of Election, was by one part of the Members appointed to be the 19. of <hi>July.</hi> The 18. was the Feaſt of St. <hi>Maximus</hi> the Martyr; whoſe Reliques had been brought ſix years before into this City with a great deal of Ceremony, as being given by the Pope to the Biſhop, and were ſhew'd in the Cathedral, where they were put for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Dioceſs, in the place of thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques which the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had burnt a hundred years before. But it is obſervable, that the Feaſt of the Reliques was kept a day before the Feaſt of St. <hi>Maximus.</hi> The ſecond day, the Biſhop would needs go to Church, with all his Epiſcopal Ornaments. But becauſe the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, contrary to the opinion of all men, there was but a ſmall appearance of Canons to wait on his Highneſs to the Quire, he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that the ſame thing would happen at this great Ceremony, to his ſhame and the ſcandal of the people, who were wont to flock to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101014:38"/> And of this he was the more jealous, becauſe contrary to his Orders, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed a meeting of the Chapter upon the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val-day, at a time when they ſhould be at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and without any neceſſity.</p>
            <p>So then when he thought that the Canons were aſſembl'd in the Quire, he ſent his Lacquy to let them know, that he intended to come to Church. But contrary to his Orders, they were got before into the Chapter Houſe to debate about the admiſſion of the three new Canons. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lacquy went to the oldeſt Beadle, to tell the Canons that the Biſhop was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to come to Church. But though he were come very near it with all his Court, there was not one that ſtir'd forth to meet him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Beadle was ſent a ſecond time to tell them the Biſhop was at hand. A great part of the Chapter upon that ſeem'd willing to riſe, but the Deans party over-perſuaded them not to ſtir, deſiring not only the admiſſion of the three new Canons, but alſo of another young Canon, whom they had ſent for with a <hi>French</hi> precipitation.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Biſhop ſtay'd at the Church door, to be conducted by the Canons through the body of the Church to the Quire, and to receive the Holy-water Pot from the chiefeſt of the train, but all to no purpoſe; not a man ſtir'd, but only one, who told the Biſhop that the greateſt part were ready to obey him; but that the reſt would not conſent. For this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101014:39"/> cauſe he made a proteſt, by his <hi>Firſt Chaplain,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Notary</hi> upon the contempt which they had put upon him in the Face of the whole world; and withal ſent word to the Canons of the Chapter to come forth and do their duties, by giving him thoſe honors and reſpects which were due to him, being at the Church-door and in his Epiſcopal Robes; or elſe that he would pronounce ſentence of ſuſpenſion againſt them all for their diſobedience. Upon which they put it to the vote, and the major part carry'd it, that they ſhould obey, and break up the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that day. Though others were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they could not be conſtrain'd by threats to attend upon the Biſhop as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them: but that it was at the good will and pleaſure of every one; and that therefore the Aſſembly ſhould not diſſolve. Now when the Biſhop had ſtay'd a long time in vain, he was fain to march by himſelf through the body of the Church, to the Quire, madded at the very heart, and not a little to the aſtoniſhment of the reſt of the Clergy, Magiſtrates and people. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the offering of the Sacrament, he aſſiſted at the <hi>Caonnical Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Vicars</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> and after that, at the great <hi>Service</hi> of St. <hi>Maximus</hi> the Martyr. In all which time not one perſon appear'd, to the great ſcorn of his Highneſs, and ſcandal of the Clergy, till at length the Chapter breaking up, the Canons came an hour after and ſeated themſelves by the Biſhop who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101014:39"/> had perform'd Divine Service alone by himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop was deeply concern'd at this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; and therefore he thought it abſolutely neceſſary to make an example of ſome, to the end he might reduce the reſt to ſubmiſſion and obedience. And therefore by vertue of his Epiſcopal Authority he diſcharg'd four of the Members of the Chapter, till they ſhould make ſubmiſſion by a publick ſatisfaction and recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This he gave them to underſtand by the Popes Notary, before the <hi>Charge of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Among the four, three were Arch-Deacons, and of them one was the Biſhops Chaplain. That very day had been appointed for the Election of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor, and therefore the <hi>Charge of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> was to be celebrated in all the Churches. The Biſhop alſo reſolv'd to aſſiſt at that Maſs, of which he gave the Canons notice, who were met at ſix of the Clock in the morning; at what time one of the Canons ſhew'd four Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> in favour of the three new Canons, which could not be admitted, as alſo of the other three whom the Biſhop had puniſh'd with ſuſpenſion: ſign'd the ſixteenth of <hi>July.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One part of the Chapter which they ſay was the leaſt, deſir'd that the Copies might be read, and that they ſhould be ſubmitted to before they ſaw the Originals. But the major part were of opinion that they ought to receive the Copies, as coming from the Metropolitan, with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but that they ſhould forbear to read them,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101014:40"/> becauſe they had had a ſecond notice that the Biſhop ſtay'd for them at the Church door. Thereupon the moſt part went to meet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; Others proteſted againſt them, as if they had refus'd to read the Metropolitans Letters, and ſubmit to them; and ſtay'd in the Chapter Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop offended at their obſtinacy, and their refuſal to give him the honor which was due to him, commanded them by a Notary to attend in the Quire upon pain of ſuſpenſion, but though he ſent a ſecond time, they took no notice of it. After Service was ended, the major part again return'd to the Chapter. Whereupon the Vicar, Lord of <hi>Bucholts,</hi> caus'd a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be openly read by the Secretary; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made another Proteſt by word of mouth againſt violence and oppreſſion; adding alſo that he made his Appeal; which being enter'd, he preſently withdrew out of the Chapter, being follow'd by ten other Canons.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops party made a Counter Proteſt. After that the Metropolitans Letters were read; but becauſe it was not mention'd whence they were written, they were ſomewhat ſuſpected. Thereupon they alſo Proteſted againſt the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Appeal'd. In the mean time, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſent to the Chapter, to tell them, that he had pardon'd the four which he had Suſpended, and that therefore they had their liberty to take their places in the Chapter, and to give their votes truly at the Election, as well as the reſt.

'Tis thought that he had brought to his bow thoſe whom he had Suſpended; leſt otherwiſe, the choice, made by an Aſſembly not compleat, might be taken for illegal and of no force. Or, according to the opinion of others; becauſe he thought them to be ſo highly offended, both they and their Favourites, that they would ſcorn to accept of ſo ſmall a favour, and that therefore he ſhould thereby have a good occaſion of an excuſe for excluding his oppoſers, as being their fault. And indeed inſtead of appearing, they declar'd publickly that they could not be preſent at the Election, nor conſent to it becauſe of their ſuſpenſion; as alſo for that the Metropolitans Orders were not obey'd, and that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Election already.</p>
            <p>Anſwer was made to this Proteſt, That there was no perſon hinder'd or excluded out of the Chapter. That the ſuſpenſion, of which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were the cauſe, was taken off, ſo far as concern'd the Election. That the Metropolitans Originals had never been ſeen; That the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not concluded, and therefore they had ſtill their votes, and Liberty to ſpeak freely.</p>
            <p>Now after they had expected two hours the return of thoſe that were ſent, there was but one of the whole number that return'd to give their votes. And therefore thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proceeded to the Election, and choſe for Coadjutor and Succeſſor to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter, Ferdinand</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> Prince
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101014:41"/> of the Holy Empire, Count of <hi>Pyrmont,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Chapter of this Province: who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was in poſſeſſion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> yet might be Elected Coadjutor and Succeſſor to the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> by vertue of an Indulgence from the Pope, which was ſhewn. But ſome concluded from hence, becauſe they had ſeen the Indulgence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Biſhop had lay'd his Plot with the Pope before hand, and then with the Canons of his Faction.</p>
            <p>We have handl'd this matter the more largely, to let the Reader ſee that as our <hi>Chriſtopher Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> was advanc'd to the Epiſcopal Chair, by the quarrels and diſſentions of the Chapter, it was in the ſame manner that he choſe to himſelf a Coadjutor and Succeſſor to his Biſhoprick. But trouble and turmoil haunted his unquiet and reſtleſs ſpirit as the ſhadow follows the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1668. the King of <hi>France</hi> had again invaded the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> taking Cities one after another; and for that reaſon the <hi>States General</hi> thought it neceſſary to arm themſelves for War, as well for their own preſervation and ſecurity, as to put themſelves into a condition that might render them able to procure Peace between the two Nations. To this end they treated with Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> for a ſupply of 600 Horſe, and 3600 Foot. This ſmall Army had no way to get into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101014:41"/> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> but with great loſs of time and many inconveniences. And therefore the States ſent the Sieur <hi>De Amerongen</hi> to the Biſhop to acquaint him with this affair, and to deſire him, that thoſe Forces might march the neareſt way through his Territories, promiſing that his Subjects ſhould not receive the leaſt detriment thereby. The Envoy alſo from the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> made him the ſame requeſt.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops anſwer was, that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt, he had enter'd into an Obligation with the Electors of <hi>Mayence, Cologn,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nieuburgh,</hi> not to aſſiſt either of the two parties, as alſo not to permit the march of any Troops through his Territories, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not conſent to their requeſt, till he had ſent notice thereof to his Allies before hand, to know their minds; to whom he alſo offer'd to ſend an expreſs for that purpoſe. The Sieur <hi>De Amerongen</hi> remonſtrated to him, that this permiſſion of paſſage did not enterfere with any thing that he had concluded with thoſe Princes; becauſe the State, had not rais'd thoſe Troops, but to be capable to make War, with an intention to procure Peace, and that they had not the leaſt deſign to make uſe of theſe Forces againſt either of the two parties, unleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by utmoſt neceſſity. But all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions wrought nothing upon him: He ſpake fair enough, but he perſever'd in his firſt anſwer,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101014:42"/> though by the firſt Article of the Treaty which he had made with the States, he were oblig'd to permit their Souldiers free paſſage through his Country.</p>
            <p>At laſt upon the urgent importunity of the Sieur <hi>De Amerongen,</hi> he told him, ſeeing that the Peace was already concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Aix La Chapelle,</hi> that he thought he might give Liberty, at leaſt he would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the march of the ſaid Troops of the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> through his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, provided they did no wrong to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but paid for what they had; which was promis'd him. At this Conference the Biſhop twice aſſur'd the Ambaſſadour with great aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of his good intentions to the States, and that he had reſolv'd to live by them in a good correſpondence and as a friendly Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he had violated the Treaty which he had concluded with the States, as having already made conſiderable Levies. To one Footman he gave eight, ſometimes ten Crowns; and all the world knew, that it was not out of own pocket; ſo that when they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this his ſo long time refuſing the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of their Souldiers, they could not but of neceſſity ſuſpect him. And indeed the plot that lay concealed under theſe probabilities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd afterwards. He was in truth Ally'd to <hi>France,</hi> and made his Levies with that Kings
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101014:42"/> mony, to Attacque the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Counſellors alſo of that Biſhop had already written into <hi>Holland,</hi> before that Monſieur <hi>De Amerongen</hi> was arriv'd in the Territories of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that it would be a difficult thing for him to obtain Liberty for the States Souldiers to paſs that way. Nor would he have ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, had not the King of <hi>France,</hi> over-aw'd by the Triple Alliance, made a Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> For though the Biſhop made uſe of the foreſaid excuſe, he had ſecretly ſent to the King of <hi>France</hi> to know how he ſhould behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon ſuch a tickliſh point, and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Kings, before he gave his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>By this Peace the Biſhop was no longer in a condition to aſſiſt <hi>France,</hi> nor to execute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which he had projected againſt the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though that in the Treaty of Peace with the States General he had quitted all his pretenſions to the Signiory of <hi>Borculo;</hi> yet it was alwaies his eager deſire to have that Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory united to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter.</hi> And as an argument for it, the <hi>Munſterians</hi> every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where diſcours'd, that their Biſhoprick was the only Bulwark againſt any Enemy that had an intention to invade the Provinces of <hi>Guelders, Frieſland, Groningen</hi> and <hi>Embden;</hi> ſo if the Eſtates, would but keep a good Correſpondence with the Biſhop, thoſe Provinces need to ſtand
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101014:43"/> in fear of nothing. And therefore it would well be worth their while to quit that ſtumbling block, and ſurrender <hi>Borculo</hi> to the Biſhop. But becauſe he well knew that he ſhould never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by ſpecious pretences, he ſtill made it his buſineſs to lay hold upon all opportunities to get that Signiory into his clutches by force; and as much more as he could. But the Peace had put a concluſion to that affair: however that he might not be idle, he occaſion'd new Trouble in <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Benthem</hi> had renounc'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion and had made publick profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Catholick</hi> in the City of <hi>Coeſvelt.</hi> O this, people diſcours'd variouſly, as their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lead them; ſome thought that the Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> perſon as the Count.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:101014:43"/>
            <p>However it were, ſo ſoon as the Count had chang'd his Religion, the Biſhop began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf in his affairs. Preſently, with a party of Horſe and Foot, and fourteen pieces of Canon, accompany'd with the Count of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them</hi> he claps down before the Caſtle of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them,</hi> believing that the Counteſs, who was within it, would ſtand upon her defence; by reaſon that the place being built upon a Rock, is ſo well Fortify'd by its ſituation, that it is impregnable, and can only ſuffer by fire. But the Counteſs, having ſent her four, others ſay ſix children to the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſent her Husband the Keys of the Caſtle, into which the Biſhop and the Count enter'd both together.</p>
            <p>The Sunday following the Bells rung to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as formerly; and the Gentlemen and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants belonging to the Count, with other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſembled to Church, as they were wont to do. But when the Miniſter came to perform his duty, they would not let him come in, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that he had nothing now to do there. This very much ſurpriz'd thoſe of the Reformed Religion, but there was no remedy but patience. Immediately after that, the Fort was ſurrender'd into the Biſhops hands to be kept by his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under the command of a Major, The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion was introduc'd and exercis'd therein, and the Jeſuites had an allowance of Lands and Goods beſtow'd upon them to build a Colledg there. The Counteſs was carry'd to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101014:44"/> 
               <hi>Munſter,</hi> and lodg'd in the Houſe of the Sieur <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> a Burgomaſter of the Town. From thence ſhe wrote a Letter to ſome of her intimate Friends, aſſuring them that her truſt was only in God, and that for all the world ſhe would not alter her Religion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> told ſome of his Friends, that he wiſh'd with all hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> about. He writes a Letter to the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101014:44"/> upon this Subject, ſign'd at <hi>Hoſtmer</hi> the 14. of <hi>September,</hi> 1668. that the Souldiers who had been before the Fortreſs of <hi>Benthem,</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free from the Oaths of Fidelity which they had ſworn to him, and Caſhier'd out of his ſervice; and that preſently after they had given their Oaths to his Imperial Majeſty, to the Holy Empire, to the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and the Holy County of <hi>Benthem;</hi> which was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify'd by the Count himſelf in a Letter dated from the Caſtle the 28. of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and yet the Biſhop in the ſame Letter, immediately after the words already recited, ſays, <hi>We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we did aſſiſt the ſaid Holy Count, for the ſecurity of his Caſtle and Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hitherto the Flames of War between the States of the United Provinces ſeem'd to be in ſome meaſure extinguiſh'd; and yet upon every ſlight occaſion you might perceive that the Embers were but cover'd up, to kindle the materials of a new fire. This ſame Prince, altogether given to quarrel, never deſiſted from making his Levies, either privately or publickly; which gave the States General ſufficient occaſion, and that not without reaſon, to be jealous of his proceedings. For they knew him too well, to be deluded by his fair words. In the Year 1669. he augmented his Levies to a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number. Yet no perſon could dive into his intentions. He aſſembl'd the States of his Dioceſs: and though by his laſt Wars they were
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101014:45"/> very much impoveriſh'd, for he not only ſhore his Sheep, but flay'd off their skins, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them a conſiderable ſum of mony; that is to ſay, that they ſhould furniſh him between the Feaſt of the Purification and Eaſter, with a hundred ſeventy five thouſand Crowns, and as much more between Eaſter and Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs.</p>
            <p>The Eſtates would by no means agree to this, becauſe the Biſhop had not diſmiſs'd certain Troops of Horſe, and ſeveral Reformado Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, without which being done, they would not break up their Aſſembly; for they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſur'd that he was meditating ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary War. The Biſhop to inveigle them, and the better to obtain his ends, diſmiſs'd the Lieutenant General of his Artillery, a Major General, three Captains, ſix Lieutenants, and four Enſigns: but the deceit of his heart was quickly diſcover'd, by his ſoon after Liſting theſe very Caſhier'd Officers again into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And beſides this, he kept an exact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence at <hi>Paris;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> mony was alſo very plentiful at <hi>Munſter;</hi> which bred no ſmall miſtruſt among his Neighbours.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Tranſactions, the City of <hi>Hamborough</hi> began to taſt of his turbulent ſpirit. Some perſons had perſuaded him, that they could find a quicker paſſage for the Poſt-Letters that paſs'd and repaſs'd through his Countries, if they might be furniſh'd at <hi>Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:101014:45"/> and not at <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> The Biſhop very inclinable to lay hold of this opportunity, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that all Letters and Pacquets directed into <hi>Holland</hi> ſhould be ſent back; and ſtopp'd up the Poſt-Road. This caus'd the Magiſtrates of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to fix upon their Poſts, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould ſend any Letters to the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> but by the Poſt-Maſters of their City, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Biſhop would admit no Poſts but his own to paſs through his Territories, and ſtill rais'd great Forces beſides, publickly giving out that no perſon ſhould preſcribe him Laws in his own Country, there was ſome apprehenſion that this affair, firſt ſtirr'd by the <hi>Trouble-world</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> would come to the deciſion of dry blows; the rather becauſe the Dukes of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> were alſo concern'd.</p>
            <p>At that time the States General began to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the King of <hi>France,</hi> fearing that he would one day invade their Dominions, becauſe that by their good management, they had prevented him from making himſelf Maſter of all the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> knowing he had no kindneſs for them ever ſince. As for the Biſhop, too many things were variouſly reported of him every day, that no body knew what to believe. Fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſo poſſeſs'd the Country of <hi>Guelders,</hi> that many people retir'd into the ſtrong Holds of <hi>Doesburgh</hi> and <hi>Arnheim;</hi> which caus'd the like conſternation in all places through which they paſs'd, though there were nothing certainly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101014:46"/> known which way the Epiſcopal Troops inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their march. The Inhabitants of <hi>Grol</hi> were no leſs in fear, becauſe that ſome of the Biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Troops were ſeen roaving about the Country every day: but their dread increas'd upon the report that the Biſhops deſign was upon <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo, Hoogheim, Holten</hi> or ſome other place.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing was reported of <hi>Groningen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But at laſt this affair was determin'd, and the agreement approv'd at a Dyet of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>Thus it remain'd till the death of the laſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, after whoſe deceaſe, the Monks of that fair Abby had choſen the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to to ſupply his place, though not by a unanimous
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101014:46"/> conſent. And now was it poſſible that he, who was ſo little a lover of Peace, ſhould let ſuch an opportunity as this fall aſleep? There were at <hi>Hoxter</hi> two Proteſtant Churches, of which there was no uſe made; and therefore he wrote to the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick, Lunenburgh,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt one of them for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. But the Duke, as Protector of the City, made him anſwer, that he would never conſent that the Priviledges of the Cities ſhould be taken from them, but that he would preſerve them, according to the above-mentioned agreement, and the Peace made in the Year, 1649. And thus the buſineſs reſted till ſome differences aroſe about the priviledges of Brewing; So that the Duke for the preſervation of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant City, was forc'd to ſend ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies both of Horſe and Foot to Guard it.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was highly offended at the placing of this Garriſon in the Town, and as he was one that ſought all occaſions of contention and War, he thought he had now found a ſmart opportunity. To this purpoſe he wrote immediately to all the Electors and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princes, except the Duke of <hi>Nieuburgh,</hi> complaining of the injury done him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> as a diſturber of the Peace, who ſupported his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel Subjects againſt him that was their lawful Soveraign, and hinder'd the exerciſe of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his own Territories: deſiring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>The ſaid Duke having read the Letter, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd a Counter <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> wherein he declar'd that the Biſhop had not touch'd at all upon the moſt conſiderable matter; and that he founded his right upon an ill grounded proceſs touching the Brewing of <hi>Hoxter.</hi> The Princes of the Circle of <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> nay the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> himſelf had written to the Biſhop, advizing him to forbear ſuch oppreſſions, and to leave the City the full enjoyment of their Priviledges: the ſame thing did the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But the more they requeſted Lenity, the more rigorous and tyrannical was he: ſo that the poor people were almoſt ruin'd. He had taken from the Council of the City, their Judicial power in Civils; ſo that they only retain'd the ſhadow of a Magiſtracy without any Authority, and all this under pretence of their having Mortgag'd their Juriſdiction; which was falſe. Or granting that were true, yet
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101014:47"/> could not he be Judg in his own cauſe, nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to himſelf all the Juriſdiction as a Judg; much leſs to Levy ſuch unheard of and cruel Executions, which had hardly left one Beaſt upon the Lands belonging to the City. Nay the Execution Cart had been in every Street in <hi>Hox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> where the Biſhops Officers took away their very Victuals, Bread, Meat, Bacon, their Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen and Beds from under them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Council of <hi>Hoxter</hi> were alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd for executing the Commands of the ſaid Council, and new Priſons were made to ſhut up the Burgeſſes of <hi>Hoxter</hi> themſelves, as faſt as they could catch them.</p>
            <p>Now by the Peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburgh</hi> in the Year 1649. the priviledg of the Brewing was particularly confirm'd to the Town accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its Antient Rights. Though afterwards they were ſomwhat diſturb'd in the injoyment of their Grant, becauſe they would not ſuffer their Beer to be ſold by the Province of <hi>Corvay,</hi> which they had always wont to do formerly. On the other ſide the Biſhop had permitted the Secretary of <hi>Corvay,</hi> call'd <hi>Maule,</hi> who was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brewer nor Citizen to exerciſe the Trade of Brewing in the City, whereby the Citizens were depriv'd of their Livelyhoods, contrary to the expreſs engagement made by thoſe of <hi>Corvay</hi> in the Year 1656. and 1649.</p>
            <p>Four or five Citizens refuſing to obey the priviledges of the Magiſtrates in the matter of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101014:48"/> Brewing, oppos'd themſelves againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, brake into the Town Houſe, and would have kill'd the <hi>Syndick,</hi> if the other Burgeſſes had not prevented them. Beſide that they made their complaints to the Regents of <hi>Corvay,</hi> where the Biſhops Counſellers heard them very kindly, protected them, and encourag'd them to farther miſchief againſt the Syndick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Council and Burgeſſes of the City perceiving what the others drove at, publickly proteſted againſt their Illegal Actions, by a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and two Witneſſes. Moreover the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſters and Council of the City wrote to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> humbly laying before him the Illegal proceedings of the Regents of <hi>Corvay,</hi> requeſting him with all ſubmiſſion to provide a remedy againſt them. Which evidently ſhews, that the Citizens of <hi>Hoxter</hi> had no deſign to withdraw their obedience from their Soveraign, but only to remedy diſorders by way of Juſtice. Beſides that, it was a diſpute between Citizens and Citizens; and therefore to be decided by the Council of the City.</p>
            <p>But at length, after the Inhabitants of <hi>Corvay</hi> were reſolv'd to proceed to execution, and had taken away the Citizens Cattel, they began to put themſelves into a poſture of Defence, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the Country people in <hi>Corvay</hi> in Arms; ſo that they were afraid of being ſurpriz'd, the Gates and Walls of their City being almoſt ruin'd. Tis true, the Biſhop vaunted in his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101014:48"/> Manifeſto, that he had us'd the City of <hi>Hoxter</hi> very kindly; and that he had exacted nothing from them for the ſupport of the common exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. They anſwer'd, that the world might judg by his actions of the favours he had done them, and that therefore his aſſeveration was not true. For ſo ſoon as he was enter'd upon the Regency, he had laid new Impoſitions upon Cattel, which nevery an Abbot before had done. Moreover when the Infantry and Cavalry of <hi>Munſter</hi> return'd from the War of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the City of <hi>Hoxter</hi> had quarter'd them all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Contribution of the Province. They had always pay'd the Taxes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Circle. He had demanded a thouſand Crowns of them for his Wars againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> He requir'd them to pay their ſhare in the Tax upon the whole Province, though he had taken from them their Brewing Trade and remov'd it into the Country, quite contrary to the old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements between the Province and the City; and inſtead of redreſſing, he had rejected their complaints, and more and more oppreſs'd them.</p>
            <p>Therefore they made it out by the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that the City might put itſelf into a Poſture of Defence againſt all Oppreſſion, by the words of the Article, which ſays, <hi>That if by neither of theſe two ways,</hi> (that is Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or Law) <hi>the matter could be determin'd in three years, They who are intereſted in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Peace, ſhall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite their Forces, take
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101014:49"/> Arms, and withſtand the oppreſſor.</hi> By which it appear'd, that it was lawful for the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> to aſſiſt the Citizens, and the rather becauſe he was their Protector, and for that he had no other aim than to defend the priviledges of the City, and to guard them from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Biſhop indeed had declar'd that it was not for Subjects to ſeek for protection without the conſent of their Soveraign. But to that they anſwer'd by the expreſs words of the Imperial Agreement in the Year 1555. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that this ſhall be no pretence to hinder them, who have been long in poſſeſſion, from putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop had alſo declar'd that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City of <hi>Hoxter</hi> did not belong to the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh;</hi> But that was made out to the contrary by the Letters of Protection of <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Magnus</hi> Dukes of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> in the Year 1332. by the Teſtimony of <hi>Timon,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Corvay;</hi> as alſo by ſeveral examples in the Years 1416. 1434. 1450. 1500. 1517. 1553. 1633. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which they added what was expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the accord between the City and the Province. That no Abbot ſhall be admitted to the Regency, unleſs he ſhall engage and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe beforehand to obſerve the agreements made with the City, and to maintain the Rights and Priviledges thereof, which was done by the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> as Adminiſtrator of <hi>Corvay:</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:101014:49"/> and conſequently they had never ſworn fealty to him.</p>
            <p>It was concluded therefore, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Province of <hi>Corvay</hi> had robb'd the Citizens of almoſt all their Cattel, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of above 450 head of Cows and Oxen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Horſes: becauſe he had Arm'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people; becauſe he had ſo many ways Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically oppreſſed the City, and for that the City had earneſtly deſir'd his protection, that therefore the ſaid Duke could not but put a Garriſon into the City. Which he did not do till he had demanded of the Regents of <hi>Corvay</hi> reſtitution of the Cattel, offering ſufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withal, that they ſhould have what they requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, in caſe the City were found to be in the fault. To which they gave no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but only that the affair concern'd him not at all, but only the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while the Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburgh</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled on neither ſide, only offer'd his ſervice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an accommodation, teſtifying by his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy how much he was troubl'd to hear theſe diſputes. One would have thought the Biſhop ſhould have thank'd him for his hind propoſal; but the <hi>Munſterian</hi> took it ſo ill, that he held him for his Enemy, and threatn'd him with open War, if he would not promiſe not to moleſt him in the retaking of <hi>Hoxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the complaints of the City of <hi>Hoxter</hi> put up to the Dyet of <hi>Regensburgh,</hi> againſt the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101014:50"/> Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> they were five in number, concerning Eccleſiaſtical matters, and thirty two as to Civil affairs. That contrary to the Peace in the Year 1649. by which the City was repoſſeſs'd of all their Prerogatives both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Secular, he had introduc'd the exerciſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, and had by violence taken away from the Proteſtants the Church of St. <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and given it to the <hi>Franciſcans.</hi> That he had erected a <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Catholick Juſtice,</hi> as he call'd it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he exacted Fines, and puniſh'd thoſe who had been already puniſh'd by the Council of the City. That he cited before his Tribunal the Citizens, Counſellers and Miniſters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and condemn'd them in great Fines; which if they refus'd to pay, his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſeiz'd upon their Houſes. That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd the Council under ſevere penalties to elect Popiſh Burgomaſters. When they made Holy-day for the Feſtival of St. <hi>Vit,</hi> at <hi>Corvay,</hi> he caus'd all the Country people of the upper Villages of the Province with their wives, children and ſervants, to march through the City Drumming and Singing and carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Images and Baubles, to the great ſcandal of the Proteſtants. If it chanc'd that this Feaſt of St. <hi>Vit</hi> happen'd upon an <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day, he ſuffer'd the ſame rabble to come to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church-door and there to make ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance that the Miniſter was forc'd to leave his Pulpit.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:101014:50"/>
            <p>In Civils, he had acted directly againſt the ſaid Peace. He had taken from the Magiſtrate all their Authority as well in Civils as Criminals which they had enjoy'd for many Ages. If the Burgomaſters and Counſellers offer'd to puniſh any Malefactor according to their duty, he lay'd ſevere Fines upon them, and levy'd them upon their Goods both within and without doors. He lay'd an execution upon Burgomaſter <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denborer,</hi> becauſe he had ſtood up for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the City, above ſixteen Years before, in the time of the deceas'd Abbat. He had taken from them their Right of Brewing, by which it was granted, that all the Beer, bought in the Town ſhould be bought of the Citizens only. He had refus'd them their antient right of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts. That he had conſtrain'd the ruin'd Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to quarter three whole Regiments of Horſe and Foot, and to provide them Fire, Salt, Meal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſeveral other oppreſſions and breaches of their priviledges too long to recite.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Colonel <hi>Bentink</hi> arriv'd at the <hi>Hague</hi> in the month of <hi>November,</hi> 1670. to acquaint the States General of the cauſe of the Levies made by the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that is to ſay, to puniſh the obſtinacy of the City of <hi>Hox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the Province of <hi>Corvay:</hi> adding withal that his Maſter, notwithſtanding all the reports to the contrary, had no other intention toward the States, than to be their good Neighbour and Friend, his deſign being only to maintain
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101014:51"/> his own rights againſt the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick Wolfenbuttel</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh.</hi> After that, he departed from the <hi>Hague</hi> for <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to buy Arms for his Maſter. But the States of the latter Province underſtanding his Errand, wrote immediately to the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, deſiring that the River <hi>Yſſel</hi> might be carefully guarded, more eſpecially that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Doesburgh</hi> might be reinforc'd; becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> had quarter'd ſeveral of his Souldiers about <hi>Brevoort,</hi> which City was in the Road to the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and not to <hi>Hox<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Thereupon it was reſolv'd that the Citie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a ſhort while after the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſent a Letter, by a Trumpeter, to the States General, wherein he wiſh'd them all proſperity for the enſuing year, offering to ſend them ſome of his men, ſo ſoon as the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between him and the Dukes ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, in regard that the States had been ſo kind as to offer their mediation in the quarrel.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>France</hi> made great Levies both Horſe and Foot. Inſomuch that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were afraid that he would Quarter his Souldiers upon them; but the King of <hi>France</hi> aſſur'd them of his ſincere intentions to the Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> However the States of the United Provinces knew not what to think. For the King bent his courſe toward the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101014:51"/> Cities of <hi>Flanders;</hi> in <hi>May</hi> he arriv'd at <hi>Tournay;</hi> and in <hi>June,</hi> he turn'd again toward <hi>France.</hi> At laſt all the world perceiv'd that he had make all his Warlike preparations againſt the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> for in a ſhort time he made himſelf Maſter of all that Country. Nevertheleſs he ceas'd not to raiſe new Forces continually, and at the ſame time he made ready a certain number of Men of War. He was wonderfully offended at the Prohibition againſt the importing of Wine and Brandy into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> though all the world perceiv'd that he intended little good to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> In oppoſition to this Placaert, he forbid his own ſubjects to lade any Strongwater or Brandy in <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſells. He alſo laid an Impoſition of twenty four Livres <hi>Paris,</hi> upon every eight Tuns of Salt Herrings coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> which afterwards he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to thirty two Livers, and three months after to forty. He laid thirty <hi>per cent.</hi> upon all ſorts of Spices, beſide the former Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>In <hi>April</hi> 1671. by the ſingular diligence of the Mediators, <hi>George William,</hi> and <hi>John Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> an agreement was concluded between Duke <hi>Radolph Auguſtus</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> upon the following conditions. That the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> ſhould quit <hi>Hoxter</hi> to the Biſhop. The Biſhop promis'd for his part not to injure the City, nor the priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101014:52"/> to it, by the Antient Conſtitutions and the Peace of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburgh;</hi> That the Citizens might make their complaints where it was proper; or elſe to the Biſhop himſelf, who promis'd to hear their complaints by indifferent Judges. In caſe the Citizens found themſelves aggriev'd by the ſentence, they might Appeal to another Judg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he promis'd much but did nothing.</p>
            <p>It was accorded by this proviſional agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meent, that the Biſhops Garriſon, which he ſhould put into this City, ſhould not conſiſt of above ſixty or ſeventy men at moſt. But the <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> had no ſooner quitted the City but he ſent thither above 250 perſons, their Wives and Children being comprehended in the number. Which caus'd an immediate grudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> becauſe they were a great charge to the City.</p>
            <p>The Citizens cry'd out, that they had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated only for a Garriſon of ſixty or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty men, and not for their Wive. and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: whereby they ſaw that the Biſhop ſought all the ways he could to ruin a Proteſtant Town: the Souldiers being allow'd to commit great diſorders; beating the Burgeſſes, and ſpoyling their goods, whereas the <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> payd to a farthing for what they call'd for.</p>
            <p>And now it appear'd every day more and more, that the Biſhop was hatching new miſchief againſt the States, which was verily thought, could not be long conceal'd. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of

               <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> being then at the City of <hi>Weſel</hi> wrote to the States, that about 800 of the Biſhops Horſe were come to Quarter in the Village of <hi>Dingen,</hi> which belonged indeed to the Territory of <hi>Munſter,</hi> but was not above a League and a half diſtant from the City of <hi>Weſel;</hi> and that for that reaſon he had taken orders for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that City. At the ſame time news was brought of a Shepheard that had been taken ſounding the depth of the Moats about the City of <hi>Weſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the Biſhop had conven'd the States of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who had promis'd him 100000 Crowns, to be paid at four payments by equal Portions in four months. About the ſame time alſo ſeveral Officers flockt to him, moſt of which he took into his Service, and gave them Commiſſions to raiſe men in his name.</p>
            <p>This exceſſive Levying of men not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed the States General, but alſo all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Neighbours: and the report went, that <hi>Cologn</hi> ſhould be firſt attack'd, our Biſhop having an Army of above 32000 men. Beſides he had caus'd 600 Cheſts to be made of Firr Wood, fill'd with the Bullruſhes, every Cheſt ſix foot ſquare, and to be faſten'd together with Iron Hooks; ſo that in a little time he could make a Bridg over any River, though never ſo wide.

            <p>In Autumn, the ſame year, the King of <hi>France</hi> ſent a large ſum of mony into <hi>Germany,</hi> of which the Biſhop had his ſhare. And now the States General thought it time to look about them. <hi>England</hi> ſtill ſtuck upon their skirts; and therefore they reſolv'd at length to raiſe a numerous Army, and fortifie their Strong Holds. But theſe Reſolutions of theirs could not well be put in execution, becauſe they could not agree in the Election of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General. For ſome of the Provinces ſtood for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but others would by no means conſent to that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1672. the deſigns of the State began to manifeſt themſelves more clearly. And yet the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> who well knew to whom he had ſold himſelf, was ſo confident as publickly to aſſure the Sieur <hi>D'Amerongen</hi> of his intentions inviolably to obſerve the Treaty laſt concluded between him and the <hi>States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but however he could not in civility deny a free paſſage to the Forces of his Allies. For all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> while he ſuffer'd the <hi>French</hi> to croud into his Dioceſs, pretending ſtreightneſs of Quarters,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101014:53"/> but in truth to be near the places upon which they had their firſt Eye.</p>
            <p>At length, in the month of <hi>April,</hi> what had ſo long time been with ſo much care and policy concealed from all the world, diſcloſed it ſelf to the view of all men. The King of <hi>France</hi> had joyn'd with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd War againſt the States General in one day. The King of <hi>England</hi> in his Declaration, gave his reaſons that induc'd him to it. But the King of <hi>France</hi> gave none but his own humour and his diſcontent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> being thus beſet, the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> accompany'd with the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> takes a journey into <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> there to conſult the beſt way to Maſter the Provinces of <hi>Over-Yſſel, Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and conſequently <hi>Holland.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of <hi>April</hi> 1672. the Biſhop ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz'd his Forces; and in <hi>May</hi> he publiſh'd his Declaration againſt the States, containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Accuſations, which indeed were no more than ſuppos'd and falſe pretences. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd the States for having dealt under hand partly by promiſes, partly by offers of ready mony with the Officers of his Forts and Cities, to have fir'd his Magazines, to have ſtirr'd up his Subjects to Rebellion, the more eaſily to make themſelves Maſters of his Towns and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. That they had caus'd ſeveral attempts to be made upon his perſon. That ſeveral fires
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101014:54"/> had happened in his Towns, Signiories and Villages, not without ſtrong preſumption that they were done by the States Emiſſaries. And therefore becauſe ſuch Barbarous actions were deteſted by the very <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, it behov'd the Biſhop to take care as well of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as of his Subjects. For which reaſon he commanded all his Officers and Governors to have a vigilant eye upon all ſuch kind of perſons, and to apprehend them as Spies, <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> and Traytors: and laſtly he forbad all manner of Commerce with the Inhabitants of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> under penalty of Confiſcation.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee this <hi>Grand Mercenary</hi> (for ſo he was generally call'd) now in a readineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Territories of the States, contrary to his Oaths, his Promiſes and Alliances.</p>
            <p>In that month of <hi>May</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> began to put his deſigns in Execution. The firſt day of the month, the Towns of <hi>Rinborch,</hi> and <hi>Orſoy</hi> were inveſted early in the morning by the King himſelf, <hi>Weſel</hi> by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and <hi>Burich,</hi> by Monſieur <hi>de Turenne.</hi> Juſt at the the ſame time the Biſhop quitted the Country of <hi>Benthem,</hi> and march'd into the Province of <hi>Tuent.</hi> He took, without much reſiſtance, the Cities of <hi>Enſchede, Oldenzeel, Otmarſen, Almelo, Borculo, Lochem, Deut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chem,</hi> and other ſmall places. He alſo commanded the Forces of the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> and beſieg'd the City of <hi>Groll,</hi> which was well Fortifi'd, but was ſurrender'd the ninth of the ſame month.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:101014:54"/>
            <p>What relyance is there in thoſe who have only the Title of Eccleſiaſticks? When <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth paſs'd through <hi>France</hi> and was Nobly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, notwithſtanding their paſt bloody Wars, the King of <hi>France</hi> was highly applauded, for that he had ſo inviolably kept his word in reference to the free paſſage of the Emperor. Upon which he gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though there were no ſuch thing as Faith and Truth among men, yet that it was abſolutely neceſſary for Kings and Princes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves of their Promiſes. But we found it otherwiſe; for upon the 16. of <hi>April</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologn</hi> publiſh'd a <hi>Placaert</hi> of Neutrality, which nevertheleſs, in ſix weeks time he utterly broke by open Acts of Hoſtility. Yet there was this difference to be obſerved between the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Cologn.</hi> For the Biſhop offer'd himſelf voluntarily to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſold himſelf to make War againſt the States General, but the other was with great difficulty and reluctancy perſuaded to break the Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Groll,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Brevoort.</hi> From thence he march'd to <hi>Deventer,</hi> in which City they had forbid the Trumpet, that keeps Watch upon the Tower, to found the Tune of the Song made in praiſe of the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Great Grand-Father to the preſent Prince.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101014:55"/> They had alſo forbid the Organiſt to Play, and the Miniſters to Pray for the Prince. They had alſo deny'd the Pulpit to one of the Miniſters, becauſe that in numbering the ſins of the people, he had made mention of their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Houſe of <hi>Orange.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Holland</hi> Mercury relates; that the principal Perſons of the Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> becauſe, they were much in debt, were frequently wont to ſay at their Meals; <hi>Come, all will go well enough yet; I hope to make my Fortuncs as well under the power of the King of</hi> France, <hi>as under the preſent Government.</hi> If this be true, we need not wonder, that by the means of ſuch Rulers this City and ſo many others ſurrender'd ſo eaſily and with ſo little reſiſtance to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>The 13. of <hi>June</hi> the Biſhop encamp'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Deventer,</hi> for the defence of which place there was nothing wanting. The fourteenth he made an attempt to drive off the Cattel which fed round about the City, but was repuls'd. Upon the ſixteenth he open'd his Trenches; and had the Townſmen had the ſole power in their hands, both <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn</hi> would have ſound work enough to have imploy'd them a far lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time; but what ever the reaſon were, it was ſurrender'd the twenty firſt. This put 1 250 <hi>Dutch</hi> Burgomaſters, already much in debt, to a worſe plunge. For firſt they took away from them all that they had, and then conſtrain'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101014:55"/> them to pay for their ranſome 65000 Livres. Thoſe that were in power had broken down the Bridg of <hi>Deventer,</hi> as they pretended, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent unneceſſary Sallies from being made upon the Enemy, though ſeveral gave their advice to the contrary. However it pleas'd the Biſhop extreamly, who was heard to ſay that time, <hi>Now I ſee that the Traytors have kept their words.</hi> See the <hi>Holland Mercury,</hi> Part 23. p. 81. The ſame ſaid the Engineers, after the taking of the Town, which was ſurrender'd after the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of the day before mention'd, without any neceſſity at all, without any notice given to the Council of War, and without the knowledg or conſent of the major part, or as others report, of any one of the Burgomaſters. More than that, they very ignobly forgot to make any proviſion for the Souldiers of the Garriſon, ſo that they all remain'd Priſoners of War.</p>
            <p>The twenty ſecond of the ſame month, the Biſhops men ſate down before the City of <hi>Zwoll,</hi> wherein they carried their buſineſs after ſuch a manner, that the Enemy found no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at all. The Author of the <hi>Holland Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> gives this accompt of the Action. Part 2. p. 82. Collonel <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nico Ripperda</hi> relates, that coming the 17. of <hi>June,</hi> with his Regiment to <hi>Zwoll,</hi> he found himſelf to be but an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gueſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The eighteenth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Troops of <hi>Over-Yſſel</hi> was conferr'd upon the Sieur <hi>W. V. Aylan,</hi> who in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101014:56"/> of Collonel <hi>Bampfield,</hi> and other Officers adviz'd the Inhabitants of <hi>Zwoll</hi> to fortifie their City. But they gave little heed to him and leſs to the Deputies of <hi>Groningen,</hi> who would have had them have ſtopt the courſe of the River, call'd the <hi>Black<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Water,</hi> ſo to have drown'd the Country round about. To which purpoſe they brought mony to carry on the work, but they talkt to people that would have no Ears. The twenty ſecond the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops men entrench'd before the Twon; at what time a certain Burgomaſter of <hi>Deventer.</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Le Eſpiere,</hi> with another call'd <hi>Benting de Brokelingcamp</hi> and a Trumpet from the Biſhop enter'd the Town; and the ſaid <hi>Le Eſpiere</hi> made a long Harangue in the Town Houſe. Thither went Collonel <hi>Bampfield</hi> to ſee how affairs were manag'd, but they lookt upon him with an evil Eye. They had, as it is reported, already in the morning ſing'd the agreement to ſurrender the Town, upon <hi>Deven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Conditions. To make ſure of <hi>Bampfield</hi> they deſir'd him to march into the City with his Regiment, which he did. And then he and <hi>Ripperda</hi> went to the Town Houſe, and entring into the Council Chamber, there they ſaw the Wine and Glaſſes upon the Table with which they had treated <hi>Le Eſpiere,</hi> who upon their coming in, went out at another door. The Burgers would have Treated them, but they refus'd it, telling them that it was then no time
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101014:56"/> to drink, but to defend the Town. <hi>Bampfield</hi> propos'd pulling down the Suburbs and making no agreement with the Enemy, without adviſing with the Officers of the Garriſon. Offering to loſe his head if they had not better Articles ſix weeks hence than then; deſiring them not to ſell their Liberty and Religion. To which, it is ſaid, that the Burgomaſter <hi>Crans</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>What likelihood have we to defend ourſelves with 1200 Souldiers and as many Townſmen, when the Town of</hi> Deventer, <hi>ſo well Fortifi'd and provided with all things could not hold out ſix days?</hi> As to the pulling down the Suburbs, they ſaid, they could give no anſwer without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Counſellers of the Commonalty, whom they would call together to know their Reſolutions. The Collonels adviſed them to do it inſtantly, and to ſend for the Captains of the City Trained Bands, but they refus'd it. Then they askt them why they had ſent back the Trumpeter? Anſwer was made, that <hi>Le Eſpiere</hi> had don it. <hi>Bampfield</hi> askt them if they would ſend Commiſſioners to the Biſhop? They reply'd, <hi>If we ſend Commiſſioners the reſt of the Troops will not march toward the City.</hi> What then, ſaid the other, muſt we be Priſoners of War? The anſwer was, <hi>They that ſign'd the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be exempted.</hi> To which the Collonels reply'd they would neither do that, nor be Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of War neither, and ſo they return'd to the Trenches, ſaying that they would make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101014:57"/> manner of agreement. One of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates cry'd, If you return, you will loſe the benefit of the Capitulation. But <hi>Bampfield</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, it would be better to dye, than make ſuch an agreement. And ſo both the Collonels the next night left the City and preſerved their men. The Magiſtrates made their advantage of the Collonels retreat, ſaying, that being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the Souldiery they were ſorc'd to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, as they excus'd themſelves in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Apology.</p>
            <p>Whether ſudden conſternation or Treachery were the cauſe of theſe things is only known to God. But moſt certain it is, that the Biſhop, with little or no hazard, made himſelf Maſter of the Cities of <hi>Deventer, Zwol, Campen, Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Swart-Sluys, Blochzyl, Steenwich Moppel, Fort de Ommen,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Kuynder</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Frize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in a few days he had ſubdu'd the whole Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel</hi> being aſſiſted by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who ſhar'd their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts after the following manner. <hi>Deven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> fell to the Elector of <hi>Cologn.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> was to keep the Cities of <hi>Campen,</hi> and <hi>Elburgh</hi> during the War, which being ended, he was to ſurrender them to the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who kept all the reſt, except <hi>Zwoll,</hi> which was to be Garriſon'd by the <hi>French</hi> as well as by him.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:101014:57"/>
            <p>On the other ſide the King of <hi>France</hi> had in a few days taken <hi>Doesburgh, Zutphen, Arnheim, Wiick, Montfort, Oudewater, Yſelſteine, Amerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foort, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and <hi>Woerden</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Some people miſinform'd have very much blam'd the City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> for ſurrendring, but all perſons that have any knowledg of affairs, will rather lament than blame them. Their ill-willers falſly reported, that they would not admit the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> into the City, for it is known that they made it their requeſt to him, and that he had granted their deſire. They ſent great quantities of Bread, Beer, and Cheeſe to the Souldiers that quarter'd about the City. They offer'd to receive as many men as he ſhould think neceſſary for the defence of the City, with whom they would hazard their eſtates and lives to the uttermoſt peny and the laſt drop of blood. But the Prince receiv'd Orders to retreat with the Army into <hi>Holland.</hi> They deſir'd him to leave the four Regiments that were paid by them; but he could not ſpare a man becauſe of the Orders he had receiv'd. All their powder in the Powder-Mills was carry'd away by the Army. The States alſo, before theſe things happen'd, had ſent a conſiderable quantity of powder to <hi>Nimighen</hi> and other places; ſo that they were deſtitute of neceſſaries, and abandon'd by the Army, and cut off from the other Provinces. But more than this, a conſiderable number of the Townſmen were in Garriſon at <hi>Nimighen</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:101014:58"/> and in the Forts upon the <hi>Yſſel.</hi> He that would ſee more of this, let him read the deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the States of <hi>

            <p>To this we may add for another reaſon the great number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, who being irreconcileable Enemies to the Reform'd Religion, would have riſen and Maſſacred them, ſo ſoon as the King of <hi>France</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with his Army.</p>

            <p>After he had furniſh'd the Cities of <hi>Over-Yſſel</hi> with good Garriſons, and alſo left a good ſtrong party upon the Frontiers of <hi>Friſeland,</hi> he march'd toward <hi>Coverden.</hi> But before we ſpeak of the taking of that City, it behoves us to mention ſomthing of the little Town of <hi>Haltem,</hi> not to deprive the couragious of their due praiſes. Their Ramparts were very weak
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101014:58"/> and defective, being decay'd by time. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon did not conſiſt of above 76 Souldiers, and 180 Burghers, who had earneſtly deſir'd the Inhabitants of <hi>Zwoll</hi> and other Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places to ſend them aſſiſtance, but all in vain. Their Ammunition alſo was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; nevertheleſs they reſolv'd to hold out.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth of <hi>June</hi> the Epiſcoparians ſhew'd themſelves before this Town, and the Biſhop ſent them his ſummons, threatning what he would do if they did not forthwith ſubmit themſelves. He had very much affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd great Towns by his thundering hard words: but this little place anſwer'd him very couragiouſly contrary to his expectation, that they would remain faithful to their Country till death. Their deeds were anſwerable to their words, for they made ſo ſtout a reſiſtance, and ply'd their ſmall ſhot with that vigor, that the Biſhops whole Army that lay at <hi>Deventer,</hi> were forc'd to be ſent for to lye before this little place. At length being out of all hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, they were conſtrain'd againſt their will to ſubmit and give entrance to the Biſhop, who was amaz'd at the ſmall number of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, knowing that he had loſt in the Siege above 700 Souldiers beſides a great number of ſtout Officers.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, before he laid Seige to <hi>Coever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> was marching toward <hi>Friſe.</hi> But upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101014:59"/> his march, he received advice that the States of <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Groningen</hi> had put themſelves into a poſture of defence, and that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make uſe of all the ſtrength they had.

               <hi>Bourtang</hi> was one Captain <hi>Prat.</hi> The Biſhop la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd to have had the place betray'd to him by the contrivance of his Commiſſary at War, whoſe name was <hi>Marſel;</hi> who offer'd the Captain 200000 Livres, or one of the faireſt Caſtles in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and for the other Captains 50000 Livres a peice.</p>
            <p>But the generous Captain deſir'd <hi>Marſel</hi> but to bring the Biſhop and his followers to confer with him, and he would give him as many Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; as he offer'd him Livres. And he behav'd himſelf ſo well, that <hi>Marſel</hi> having laid Siege to the place, was forc'd to raiſe it again in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Biſhops whole Army arrived before <hi>Coeverden,</hi> which was as it were, the Key of the Provinces of <hi>Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen.</hi> It was lookt upon formerly as impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101014:59"/> by reaſon of the Marſhes, and Fens that ſurround it, and which may be eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd: ſo that there is no coming near the Town but by three narrow paſſes, which were guarded by ſeven Bulwarks by the name of the Seven Provinces, with ſeven Ravelins, ſeven half Moons, and beſides that an out-Wall, a high Counterſcarp, deep double Motes, two Gates and a Caſtle Fortified with five other Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and a deep Moat next the City. This noble Fortreſs after the Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> was fallen much to decay through neglect, as were many other of the Fortreſſes belonging to the States; and beſide that, it was not over provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Ammunition.</p>
            <p>The 30. of <hi>June,</hi> the place was inveſted by 1100 <hi>French</hi> Horſe, and ſix thouſand Foot, who moſt unmercifully pillag'd and plunder'd the Inhabitants of the Flat Country, ſome alſo they put to torture, and others they murder'd. The ſeventh the place was ſummon'd; but the ſummons was rejected. The tenth it was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd again; whereupon the Governour ſent out Commiſſioners and made an agreement.

               </hi> where the Biſhop gave peculiar command to the Inhabitants under pain of Confiſcation of their Goods and other Corporal penalties, not to ſupply the poor weary Souldiers either with meat or drink though they ſhould pay for it.</p>
            <p>After the Enemy had taken <hi>Coeverden,</hi> they held a great Council of War, to conſult what was next to be done; whether they ſhould march into <hi>Friſe,</hi> and beſiege the City of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:101014:60"/> or whether they ſhould Attack the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Delf-zyl:</hi> But they were divided in opinion, ſome believing this, ſome that to be more expedient. The Biſhop would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their advice who were for the Attacking the place laſt nam'd, had not <hi>Schulenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Broerſma,</hi> two Traytors to their party, as moſt Writers call them, vigorouſly perſuaded him to beſiege <hi>Groningen.</hi> While they were upon the debate the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> came into the Council, who demanded ſmiling what they had agreed upon, and perceiving that ſome were ſtill for Attacking <hi>Delf-zyl: No, no,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we muſt go to</hi> Groningen, <hi>that City will be ours in five days, I have my Confidents there.</hi> But he fail'd in his aſſurance.</p>
            <p>Till this time a favourable Gale had ſwell'd the Sails of the Biſhops hopes. He had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken no enterprize wherein he had not proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſucceeded. No place was ſo ſtrong or ſo well fortifi'd but that he made his way through, either through the Cowardice or Treachery of the defendants. His Maſter to whom he had Mortgag'd himſelf, had pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated even to the very Center of <hi>Holland.</hi> So that in forty days the Confederates had taken fourſcore Cities, Forts and Fortreſſes from the States General.</p>
            <p>As for the Conqueſts of the Biſhop of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> he thought himſelf ſure enough of his prey, not believing that the <hi>

The King of</hi> France <hi>is beholden to me, for without my Aſſiſtance he never could have Conquer'd ſo faſt nor ſo much.</hi> At his requeſt, he obtain'd of the Pope the Government and abſolute Authority to conſer all Eccleſiaſtical Benefices in the Territories by him Conquer'd.

            <p>But the wheel of Fortune, if it be lawful for Chriſtians to make uſe of the Phraſe, began to turn, ſo that from this time forward the Tide of the Biſhops proſperity began to Ebb. It pleas'd God that he follow'd the worſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of them that adviz'd to lay Siege to the City of <hi>Groningen;</hi> and to inſpire the Inhabitants of that City with courage and reſolution, to repel the victorious B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhop, and to force him to riſe from before their Walls with loſs and ſhame. After which he never did any thing that brought him either profit or honor, but all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes prov'd deſtructive to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Groningen</hi> then was the place which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to beſiege; for by the taking of this City, which they imagin'd would have been an eaſie matter, they had made themſelves Maſters of two Provinces, that and <hi>Friſeland.</hi> The Place was ſufficiently ſtrong, but the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was too weak; not conſiſting, recruits and all, of above one thouſand and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers. But the valor of the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Scholars ſupply'd that defect, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Conduct of the Commanders, among whom the Sieur <hi>Charles Rabenhapt</hi> was the chief. The Burgers were divided into Eighteen Companies, beſides Four Companies of them who had been formerly excus'd. The Company of Scholars conſiſted of a hundred and fifty.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:101014:62"/>
            <p>The 19. of <hi>July</hi> the Country people brought word that the Enemy appear'd on every ſide of the City. The 20. they ſhew'd themſelves upon <hi>Helpen</hi> ſide. The ſame day one of the Porters of the City was executed, being accus'd of Treachery, becauſe he had left open the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Gate a whole night together; as alſo a Country-man of <hi>Olde Ampt</hi> who had corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded with the Biſhop. The eleventh they made their firſt ſhot at the City, but the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth they began to play furiouſly upon it, endamaging ſeveral houſes: and after Dinner the ſame day ſeveral of the Officers and Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhew'd themſelves upon the Ramparts where they made merry and drank ſeveral Healths, the great Guns going off and the Drums and Trumpets ſounding at the concluſion of every one.</p>
            <p>The Eighteenth the Biſhop and Arch-Biſhop, for the Biſhops of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> who did not very well agree before, had now joyn'd their Forces, which caus'd ſome to ſay that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were reconcil'd, follow'd their buſineſs very ſmartly: They ſhot their <hi>Bombs</hi> into the City which did much miſchief; ſome of them weighing three hundred, ſome four hundred pound. The Shell was about three or four fingers thick fill'd within with Pitch, Roſin, Salt-peter and Gun-powder. Their weight caus'd them to break through the Roofs and Tilings of Houſes, till they met with Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101014:62"/> matter enough to ſet whole Houſes on fire. In the night time they ſhot great numbers of Granados into the Town, which did very much damage in ſeveral parts and quarters of the City. They were ſluft with all ſorts of Combuſtible Matter that eaſily took fire, and they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them little ſmall things like ſmall guns about a fingers length which diſcharg'd ſeveral Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-bullets againſt thoſe that drew near to quench them: They were very terrible at firſt, as having wounded ſeveral people that came too near them; but let them alone till they had ſpent their Bullets, and they were eaſily manag'd.</p>
            <p>By this time the Biſhop wonder'd very much, that the City did not ſend out Commiſſioners to Treat of a Surrender, after he had thrown ſo many Bombs and Fire-Balls among them. But they had too great a love for their Country and their Religion, to think of any ſuch thing. Nay ſomtimes they pay'd him with his own Coyn, which he had never met with before. Inſomuch that the Souldiers in the Trenches would cry one to another, <hi>They in the City make uſe of the ſame Devils that we do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 20. they ply'd the City with their Bombs and Fire-Balls. The firſt of which did much miſchief; but the latter were eaſily ſtified.</p>
            <p>The 22. both the Biſhops ſummon'd the City, but their anſwer was both reſolute and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101014:63"/> ſurly. The ſame day the Enemy made ſeveral Attacks upon the <hi>Auwerder. Zyl,</hi> but were vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly repuls'd. The number of the ſlain is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but they confeſs'd that thoſe Onſets loſt them more men, than all their Conqueſts had done.</p>
            <p>Now though the Citizens beheld the ruin of their Habitations every day, yet were they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſmay'd for all that, but as they met one another in the ſtreets their uſual queſtions were, <hi>How is your houſe? Mine is almoſt down to the ground. So is mine. But let us pluck up a good heart; this Biſhop of Granados ſhall not have our City for all this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The women were no leſs couragious than their Husbands. They were leſs troubl'd to behold a Fire ball fall into their houſes, than they were before to ſee a Clown with dirty ſhooes come into their Dining-Rooms. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain woman, who had but one houſe, ſeeing a <hi>Bomb</hi> rowl through it began to fill her Apron with ſome trifles and a Silver Goblet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into the ſtreet, ſhew'd thoſe that came to help her, the Goblet, ſaying, <hi>Yet will I give this to his Excellency Rabenhaupt,</hi> if he will but keep the City. Another Bomb entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ruins of her Houſe ſhe cry'd to thoſe that were with her, <hi>The beggerly Biſhop ſhall not get in this way I am reſolv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:101014:63"/>
            <p>All this while the Biſhop plagu'd the City with his B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Epiſcoparians</hi> alſo ſhot pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that made no noiſe, and they made uſe of Great Guns pickt and cull'd for the purpoſe. It happen'd one time among the reſt, that the Citizens thought that they had perceiv'd the Enemy preparing for an Aſſault; whereupon the Scholars, Souldiers and Citizens ſhew'd themſelves upon the Ramparts; the women alſo prepar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The laſt of <hi>July,</hi> in ſome of the Biſhops great Bombs they found a little plate of Copper, one ſide whereof was full of Characters which could not be read; from whence it is thought that he expected ſome Magical Effect: upon which a certain Doctor in a diſcourſe upon the Siege and raiſing of it made this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>That when the Biſhop could not take the Town by the aſſiſtance of</hi> Simon Peter, <hi>he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to have it by the help of</hi> Simon Magus.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101014:64"/> For the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have more than once made uſe of ſuch abominable ſuperſtitions. When the deceas'd Prince of <hi>Orange, Frederick Henry</hi> in the Year 1629. had beſieg'd the City <hi>Bois le Duc,</hi> after the Surrender of the place, ſeveral Papers were found full of barbarous words and Conjurations; and in ſome places the name of God and ſeveral Saints were inſerted. It is thought that the Prieſts had ſold or given them to the Souldiers and Townſmen to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from the Swords and Bullets of their Heretick Enemies.</p>
            <p>But all his Epiſcopal Magick did him no good: nay the more to fret him, the Scholars who guarded the Out-wall, and behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very bravely, had invented ſeveral nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names for the Biſhop, by ſome of which he heard himſelf call'd, when he came into the Trenches, and bitterly ſtorm'd at his new Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; his Officers alſo laid the affronts of their Captain to heart, and vow'd to be reveng'd when once they got into the City, The 15. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the beſiegers ſhooting continually into the Town a Canon Bullet almoſt graz'd upon a Hoggs back, but did the creature no other harm, than only ſinge the Briſtles; whereupon the Scholars cry'd out from the Out-wall in the night to the beſiegers, that the Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhear his Hoggs now he had fleec'd his Sheep.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:101014:64"/>
            <p>The day before the Biſhop and ſent a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter to the Town, requiring firſt that they would let him ranſom certain Officers which had been taken Priſoners in a Salley, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would uſe them kindly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that they would ſend ſome ſweet meats for his mony, to Treat certain Ladies of the County of <hi>Heſſen</hi> that were come to the Camp. As to the firſt demand anſwer was made that it was not the cuſtom to releaſe Priſoners of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, when the Enemy was before their Walls, and as for their uſage they were ſure, they had better than any the Biſhop allow'd: and for his ſecond requeſt, they reply'd, that being taken up with Powder and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they minded little of their Shops at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Biſhop perceiv'd that his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize upon this place would not have the ſame ſucceſs as he had had in other places. The Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> though he had adviz'd the Siege, began to look upon his Colleague with an evil Eye; and they began to quarrel already about the expence of the Siege and the waſt of their Countries. <hi>Cologn</hi> upbraided <hi>Munſter</hi> with his boaſts he made of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, his Artificial Fires, and his Miners, and yet that after the Moat of the Curtain was fill'd up with Fagots, he durſt not venture the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; for fear of loſing his men.</p>

            <p>In the mean while the Young Prince of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw</hi> had written a letter in <hi>French</hi> from the Camp before <hi>Groningen</hi> dated the 20. of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> N. S. and directed to the Duke of <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The 17. A Forlorn of Gentlemen ſally'd out of the Town and found that the Enemy had quitted their Approaches. Upon news whereof ſeveral of the beſieg'd went forth and found in the Enemies Trenches great ſtore of Warlike Ammunition as Bombs, Fire-balls, Granados, Bullets, Hatchets, Shovels and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101014:65"/> like, of which every one took as much as they could carry away. Their Retreat was very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the Infantry were in ſuch a fright, that the Horſe were commanded to recure them from flying. All this while the Biſhop lay behind the Gallows Hill; but the 21. he fully and wholly quitted the place, which caus'd a Univerſal joy among the Inhabitants of the Town.</p>
            <p>This Biſhop diſlodg'd his Army for two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reaſons. The firſt was, for that his great Guns were no longer ſerviceable, and his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpieces were moſt of them ſpoil'd. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was becauſe his Army was half in half waſted.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt reaſon, his Artillery was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all ſpoil'd and broken, ſo that he had not above ten or twelve Guns left, by reaſon of his continual firing upon the Town. As for his Morter-pieces, he had not above five or ſix left; For the Biſhop impatient of the Protraction of of the Siege, order'd them to be double charg'd, ſo that ſome of his Morter-peices broke, and others were greatly indammag'd.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond cauſe, it could never be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known what number of men he brought to the Siege; but tis thought that they amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to between twenty and thirty thouſand; and he did not march off with above thirteen thouſand. This was afterwards confirm'd by a Muſter made by the Biſhops Officers: by which it appear'd, that his Army when they firſt came
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101014:66"/> before <hi>Groningen</hi> conſiſted of above twenty four thouſand men, but that he carry'd off no more than twelve thouſand nine hundred ſixty eight. So that he had loſt eleven thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty two.</p>
            <p>To theſe two reaſons that oblig'd the Biſhop to quit the Siege, may be added three more. 1. The coming of the Auxiliary Forces of the Emperor and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> 2. The want of Ammunition and Victuals. 3. The Rain that fell at that time whereby his Approaches were quite overflow'd with water. However it were, the City was at liberty, and the Biſhop was no more in a condition to make any farther attempt.</p>
            <p>We cannot here paſs over in ſilence the moſt barbarous cruelty that was ever exercis'd upon poor ſick and wounded men, who were carry'd to <hi>Helpen</hi> into a Barn, where they lay without ſtraw, being lookt after by ſix <hi>French</hi> Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Biſhop perceiving that their number every day increas'd, askt the Chirurgeons which they thought to be curable and which not; and thoſe that were judg'd incurable were preſently diſpatch'd with a Bullet ſhot into their heads to make room for others.</p>
            <p>The beſieg'd had not loſt above fourſcore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, notwithſtanding that vaſt number of Bombs, Stinking-Pots, and Fire-Balls which were thrown into the City, the number of which was ſaid to have amounted to above four
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101014:66"/> thouſand: for as for the Canon-ſhot it was not to be counted. And indeed the effects of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence were moſt apparently to be ſeen, in reference to ſome perſons, conſidering the prodigious deliverance from eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>A Fire-ball, meeting with the Wall of a Houſe, was beaten back, and falling paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Mennonites</hi> Breeches below the Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, without doing him any other harm than only ſinging his Breeches.</p>
            <p>One of the Sheriffs of the Town, whoſe name was <hi>Bothenius,</hi> being juſt riſen out of his Bed, a Fire-ball preſently came and falling in his place burnt the Coverlet, Mat, Bedſtead and all.</p>
            <p>The Widow of <hi>Anthony Van Eſſen</hi> being in Bed with her Daughter, a Fire-ball paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and being reſiſted by the Beds head, return'd the ſame way, without doing any more hurt than burning the Bed.</p>
            <p>A woman ſitting upon a bench before her own houſe, a Fire-ball flew between her legs, and carry'd away a piece of her Coats both before and behind without any farther miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing happen'd to one of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,</hi> who ſitting in his Study; a Fire-ball came and carry'd away the Seat from under him without any farther damage.</p>

            <p>Another Bomb lighted into the Chamber of a certain perſon, who not liking his Bedfellow, took it and flung it to the ground where it broke, and ſpoyld all his goods, but did the man no harm.</p>
            <p>A woman being a ſleep in her Bed, by break of day was awakn'd by a <hi>Bomb</hi> that fell through the Cieling juſt before her Bed.

            <p>Another woman having a little child in her Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perceiving a <hi>Bomb</hi> to be fallen into her Houſe, all in a fright, threw her infant into the Ciſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to return to the Biſhop. The <hi>Frizous</hi> laying hold of the opportunity, made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with the aſſiſtance of the Men of War that guarded the <hi>Zuyder Zee,</hi> upon the Fort of <hi>Block Zyl,</hi> ſeated upon the ſaid <hi>Zuyder Zee,</hi> between <hi>Wallenhaven, Kuynder</hi> and <hi>Steenwick,</hi> where are two ſluces that give free paſſage to the

The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the Biſhop miſtruſting them, would have forc'd them to take an Oath of Fidelity to his Maſter, which they refus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to do. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he threatned them hard; but they reply'd, They would ſuffer the utmoſt ſeverity, before they would take the Oath which he exacted from them. Although the <hi>Frizons</hi> landed to the number of four hundred and fifty. The Commander made a Sally upon them, was rudely repuls'd; and he would have reenter'd the Fort, the Burgers fir'd upon the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parians, kill'd the Commander and open'd the Gate to the <hi>Frizons;</hi> and ſo the Fortreſs was reduc'd under the obedience of the States.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time a certain <hi>Mennonite</hi> put a fair cheat upon the Epiſcoparians; For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he liv'd near the South gate, when he ſaw the terrified Souldiers thronging out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he offer'd ſome of them his houſe to ſecure themſelves; which offer of his was kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by ſixty or ſeventy of them, among which were two Lieutenants and a Prieſt, whom he afterwards deliver'd up all together as Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Fortreſs of <hi>Kuynder</hi> alſo fell into the hands of the <hi>Frizons:</hi> from which time
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101014:68"/> the Biſhop prov'd very unfortunate, for he got nothing, but loſt a great deal.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Old Ampter-Mieden</hi> the Epiſcoparians committed ſeveral Inſolencies and Rapines: and it was fear'd that they would have fir'd the Dams of <hi>Munterdam, Veendam,</hi> and <hi>Wilvank,</hi> which would have occaſion'd very much miſchief the Winter enſuing: for prevention whereof ſeveral Souldiers were ſent to <hi>Mieden.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men glad to be ſo guarded were ſo liberal to the Souldiers that they got drunk, at what time being ſurpriz'd by the <hi>Munſterians,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to rally themſelves into a poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they were forc'd to fly for their lives. The Country-men however made a ſtout reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for ſome time, but being over-power'd, they were all defeated and kill'd, except ſome few that ſav'd themſelves in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes.</p>
            <p>After that came ſeveral Troops of Horſe and Foot under the Command of St. <hi>German,</hi> Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the <hi>Holland</hi> Regiment, which got into the City of <hi>Groningen</hi> during the Siege. With theſe Forces he marcht toward <hi>Winſchoten,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſight of ſeveral parties of the <hi>Munſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> by the way, who retreated upon their approach and quitted not only <hi>Winſchoten,</hi> but alſo the ſmall Fort of <hi>Winſchoter-Zyl, Wedde</hi>-Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhelter'd themſelves under the <hi>Old-Fort,</hi> and new <hi>Fort,</hi> where they thought themſelves ſafe. And indeed it ſeem'd a thing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101014:68"/> impoſſible by force to Attack thoſe two Forts, in regard all the Country round was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd. However Collonel St. <hi>Jerman</hi> ſent ſome of his men to the places next adjoyning to the Old Fort, otherwiſe call'd <hi>Bellingwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derskans,</hi> to block it up at a diſtance. At the beginning little good was to be done, beſides that the Collonel was commanded back into <hi>Holland.</hi> Thereupon his Excellency <hi>Raben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haupt</hi> took the buſineſs in hand, ordering Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Eybergen</hi> upon the ſame Enterpize, who being ſtrengthen'd with a Reinforcement, laid Siege to the place. About a thouſand and four hundred Epiſcoparians came out of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> paſſing through <hi>New-Fort,</hi> to relieve the <hi>Old;</hi> but they were ruggedly repuls'd by two hundred and fifty Souldiers under the Command of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Neylers,</hi> a brave and experienc'd Souldier, who had ſo advantagiouſly poſted his men, that the Epiſcoparians having made a ſecond attempt retreated to the <hi>New-Fort</hi> with the loſs of eight hundred men ſlain, after which the <hi>Old-Fort</hi> Surrender'd: Of four hundred Souldiers that quitted the place, not above a hundred ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Coeverden,</hi> the reſt deſerting their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Old-Fort</hi> was taken, the <hi>New-Fort</hi> was blockt up; and upon the arrival of the Auxiliaries of <hi>Curland,</hi> the Epiſcoparians quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Dyler-Fort</hi> upon the 16. of <hi>November.</hi> For the preſervation of which place the Fort of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101014:69"/> 
               <hi>Bourtang</hi> ſent a hundred and twenty Musketeers under the Command of Captain <hi>Aitzema,</hi> who was a very young man, and wrote to the States of <hi>Groningen,</hi> that if the Epiſcoparians made any Attack upon him, they ſhould find that place guarded by a courage not ordinary. But when the <hi>Munſterians</hi> ſhew'd themſelves near the Fort with three thouſand men, the Captain quitted his <hi>Hold,</hi> without ſo much as looking the Enemy in the Face, who preſently repoſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Dyler-Fort,</hi> and from hence reliev'd the <hi>New-Fort,</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were forc'd to raiſe the Siege, the ſeaſon being paſs'd.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, two hundred <hi>Curlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> having march'd too far into <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> to Plunder, were totally defeated, though the Epiſcoparians bought their Victory with the loſs of more men on theirs, than on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>And now the time was come that <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> ſufficiently plagu'd and oppreſs'd by its own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, muſt alſo taſt the bitterneſs of a Foreign Enemy. For the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving declar'd War againſt the Biſhops of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> and the reſt of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confederates, his Souldiers began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the Country, Plundering wherever they came, and putting the Inhabitants under Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. They alſo took ſome Waggons laden with Cloth, Mony, Proviſion and Ammunition.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:101014:69"/>
            <p>Thereupon the Biſhop gathers his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, withdraws his men out of his new Conqueſts, and falls into the Countries of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> and <hi>La Marche,</hi> doing great miſchief. He alſo took <hi>Lunen,</hi> the City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nna,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Beda.</hi> Nevertheleſs he was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forc'd to quit <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nna,</hi> upon the approach of the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Troops; and preſently after that, all the reſt of the Country.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> finding that the Biſhop thriv'd ſo ill in the Province of <hi>Groningen,</hi> was ſomwhat jealous leſt he ſhould change his ſide according to his uſual Cuſtom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to oblige him to be Faithful, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him the Abby of St. <hi>Germans de Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perees,</hi> ſo that he kept firm to his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Biſhops Garriſons of <hi>Steenwick</hi> and <hi>Coeverden,</hi> committed ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions and diſorders in the <hi>Drenthe</hi> which thoſe of <hi>Groningen</hi> were not able to prevent; For though they ſought every where to meet with them, they could never light upon them, in regard the Epiſcoparians being ſtill adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd by their Spies, retreated in time to their Forts. Nor was there any way to remedy theſe miſchiefs, ſo long as the Cities of <hi>Steenwick</hi> and <hi>Coeverden</hi> were in the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>Of the Fortifications of <hi>Coeverden</hi> we have already ſpoken, the ſtrength whereof was ſuch, that in the Year 1594. <hi>Verdugo</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101014:70"/> lay before it one and thirty weeks, and at length was forc'd to raiſe his Siege. But no ſooner had the Biſhop taken it by Treachery in four days, but he brought his Magazines thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from thence perpetually infeſted the Frontires of <hi>Friſeland, Groningen,</hi> and <hi>Drenthe.</hi> And for the better preſerving a Garriſon ſo Commodious, and of ſo great importance he not only repair'd the Old Fortifications but made an addition of New Works, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the former, yet notwithſtanding all this care and foreſight, neceſſity compell'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> to ſeek to regain it.</p>
            <p>This being reſolv'd, luckily for them it fell out, that <hi>Maynard de Thynen</hi> a good Ingeneer, and formerly Church-Warden of the Town, gave a hint to his Excellency <hi>Rabenhaupt,</hi> that the Town might be ſurpriz'd; in regard the Biſhops Garriſon was very much waſted by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that they who were well, confiding in the ſtrength of the Fortifications, kept but very ſlender Watches. Beſides that he gave him a plat-form of the place, and of all the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ſhewing him where he might get over the Marſhes when they were Frozen. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency approving the propoſal, the 16. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1672. caus'd all the Gates of the City of <hi>Groningen</hi> to be ſhut at three of the Clock af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner, he ſent Orders for ſuch and ſuch parties to meet at a place appointed. He choſe out of every Company in the City thirty ſix
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101014:70"/> men, giving the Command of the whole party to Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Eyberghen,</hi> an experienc'd Officer. The foot were Commanded by Major <hi>Wylers,</hi> the Horſe by the Valiant Major <hi>John Sickinga.</hi> All the night they ſpent in load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waggons with Bridges made of Ruſhes, Ice-Spurrs, and all other things requiſite for an Onſet.</p>
            <p>The 17. about One of the Clock the Cavalry marcht out at <hi>Steenwick Gate,</hi> and three hours after the Foot follow'd out at <hi>Steenhil Gate,</hi> to the number of nine hundred ſixty eight, among which were ſeveral Volunteers of the Gentry, Burgeſſes and Scholars. Advancing near the Gallows Mount, he obſerv'd a Trumpeter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Town of <hi>Helpen,</hi> who ſeeing ſuch a Force, immediately gallop'd back taking the Road to <hi>Halrem.</hi> But Major <hi>Sickinga</hi> being well mounted follow'd him, took him and ſent him away to <hi>Groningen.</hi> This was one of the Biſhops Trumpetters, or as others ſay, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prince of <hi>Fuſtenburgh,</hi> who was in the Biſhop of <hi>Cologns</hi> ſervice, who was carrying Letter to the Council of the ſaid City. The Cavalry march'd toward <hi>Gieten</hi> there to ſtay in expectation of the Infantry. From <hi>Gieten</hi> they marcht to <hi>Exfield, Emmen, Sleen, Erren, Wachlen,</hi> and <hi>Dalen,</hi> taking all the care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to prevent being diſcover'd, and yet three Dragoons made a ſhift to ſlip away and give the Enemy notice of the whole deſign,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101014:71"/> which piece of Treachery was enough to have ſpoil'd all; but Providence was pleas'd to order it otherwiſe. For after that the Garriſon kept a conſtant watch day and and night, and were continually in Arms, which hard duty ſo tyr'd the Souldiers at length, that when the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ault was given they were moſt of them aſleep, thinking it had been but a falſe Alarum.</p>
            <p>Upon the 19. the word and ſignal of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack being given; every Souldier having a wiſp of Straw in his Hat, Collonel <hi>Eyberghen</hi> Commanded ſix hundred men to march dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly toward <hi>Tellinckhuyſen</hi> and from thence to <hi>Poppenhaer,</hi> carrying with them twelve pieces to make a Bridg of Bullruſhes and ſo to poſſeſs themſelves of the <hi>Counterſcarp</hi> with as little noiſe as might be, and break down the Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſados. <hi>Eyberghen</hi> himſelf with three hundred Souldiers undertook the Caſtle, a hundred and fifty of others were to aſſail the <hi>Guelders</hi> Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, and another hundred and fifty to force the Guard in the Citadel before the Gate of the Caſtle. Major <hi>Wiliers</hi> with three hundred men was to undertake the <hi>Holland</hi> Bulwark, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Captain to force the Guard of that Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark. Two hundred more were to aſſail the <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> Bulwarks, fifty to ſeize upon <hi>Benthem</hi> Gate; Major <hi>Sickinga</hi> was order'd to attack the Bulwark of <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> and take care of the management of the buſineſs in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:101014:71"/>
            <p>Which Orders being thus given, and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War call'd between Eleven and Twelve a Clock at night, about three a Clock in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they got cloſe to the works. <hi>Eyberghen</hi> and <hi>Wylers,</hi> though good Souldiers found the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Enterprize very difficult; but <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> the Engineer, hearten'd them on, and marcht formoſt to ſhew them the way. By and by they heard the Sentinels calling, <hi>Who is there? Thynen</hi> made no anſwer, which made them redouble the <hi>Who is there,</hi> with a thouſand <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> Oaths. At length the Onſer began; and they that marcht firſt got upon the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, beyond the firſt Moat to the very Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does. The Enemy fir'd very furiouſly, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> advancing couragiouſly, cut down the Palliſadoes and open'd a paſſage for themſelves, and ſo <hi>Eyberghen</hi> and <hi>Wylers</hi> mounted the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and at length made themſelves Maſters of the Caſtle, <hi>John Moor</hi> who Commanded it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kill'd at the beginning of the Onſet with a Musket ſhot. Major <hi>Sickinga</hi> aquitted himſelf with no leſs Valour on the other ſide, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving won the Counterſcarp, and got over the Palliſadoes and Moat to the top of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, forc'd the Enemy to throw down their Arms and cry Quarter.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Clingh</hi> alſo by this time forc'd the Guard of <hi>Friſeland</hi> Gate, which got open by the aſſiſtance of one of the Burgeſſes, and ſo made way for the Cavalry. A party of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101014:72"/> made a ſtout reſiſtance for a good while in the Market place, but finding themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd, threw down their Arms, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring themſelves Priſoners of War, were ſhut up in the Church. The Town thus won, the Victors fell to Plundering and found good ſtore of booty. It is obſervable that ſome of the Townſmen, overjoy'd to ſee themſelves freed from the Tyranny of an inſulting Enemey, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd their own houſes to the Souldiers. Many of the Enemies had their Pockets full of mony, their Coats Embroider'd, and the Hilts of their Swords of maſſie Silver.</p>
            <p>The Enterpriſe being thus proſperouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, the Officers ſoberly conſidering the ſtrength of the place, could not chooſe but look upon one another with aſtoniſhment, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to another, <hi>How could this poſſibly be? behold the band of God.</hi> When the news of this ſucceſs arriv'd at <hi>Groningen,</hi> the joy of the Inhabitants was not to be expreſs'd. The next day was ſolemniz'd with a publick Thankſgiving in all the Churches. The Courrier that was ſent with the News to the States was laden with Letters; and yet all the way upon the Road he was lookt upon as a Reporter of falſities. At <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uwarden</hi> he was almoſt crouded to death by the throng of the people: and at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it was lookt upon as a thing impoſſible and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incredible. A certain Perſon of Quality in his anſwer to a Letter which gave an accompt of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101014:72"/> the News from <hi>Groningen</hi> wrote theſe words, <hi>I am reſolv'd never to give my mony for a Letter that contains ſuch untruths. We have falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports enow in</hi> Holland, <hi>we have no occaſion of having them ſent from</hi> Groningen. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks laught at the ſtories of the <hi>beggarly Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as they call'd us; but when they found the news to be true, we could perceive that they were nothing pleas'd with it.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that whatever was thought would have prov'd an obſtruction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was that which chiefly promoted it. The Forces arriv'd later than they were order'd: But that made the Enemy believe that the Dragoons had abus'd them. The Onſet ſhould have been given at midnight, which was delay'd till three of the Clock in the morning. But thereby it happen'd, that the Souldiers tyr'd with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were gon to ſleep. There fell a great miſt, ſo that <hi>Thynen</hi> who was their guide loſt his way. But that conceal'd them from the view of the Enemy, ſo that they were not perceiv'd, till it was too late. So that through the continual noiſe of the Sentinels crying, <hi>Who goes there,</hi> and the others anſwering the <hi>Round,</hi> the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants had the opportunity to cut the Palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does without being heard.</p>
            <p>Now as the retaking of this Town inſpir'd a Univerſal joy and courage into the diſhearten'd people of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſo it bred a general conſternation in the other party.</p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:101014:73"/>
            <p>The Garriſons of <hi>Nyenhuys</hi> and ſeveral other places in the County of <hi>Benthem</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Tuent</hi> quitted their Ports. In <hi>Zwoll, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter</hi> and other Towns of <hi>Over-Yſſel</hi> they were in a panick dread. So that had a ſmall Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, thoſe places might have been eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>But when the news of this loſs came to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> he was all in a fume againſt the perſon that brought it; as if he had gone about to make him believe falſe reports and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities. But when after a ſerious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the circumſtances he found the thing to be real, his thoughts were in a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; <hi>I fear me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſhall ſuddenly loſe all that I have got, ſince I have loſt my little</hi> Candy. His rage and diſcontent was ſuch, that he lookt with a ſurly Countenance upon all that came near him for ſome days afterwards, and curs'd in the Devils name more than once. He call'd the Officers of the Garriſon <hi>Dogs, Rogues and Traytors,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Groningen, damn'd Hereticks:</hi> nay he could not refrain from lamenting his loſs with Tears. About a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of his men were ſlain outright, and four hundred taken Priſoners, with ſix Captains, eleven Lieutenants, fourteen Enſigns, and three Church-men. In his Magazine were found ſixty one great Guns, Braſs and Iron, twenty four Morter-peices, thirty Petards, nine hundred forty nine Muskets, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101014:73"/> and eighteen Pikes, five hundred and ſix Barrels of Gun-powdur, one thouſand two hundred ſeventy and ſeven Bombs ready made up, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty not finiſh'd, two thouſand one hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Stinking Pots, one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventy and two Granadoes, and twelve thouſand eight hundred fifty and two Canon Bullets, great ſtore of Sulphur, Saltpeter, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, Oyl, Turpentine and Pitch; beſides Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, Carriages, Waggons, Hatchets, Saws, Spades, and the like.</p>
            <p>But now the Emperor ſeeing that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt which had pour'd it ſelf upon the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> would not end there, but that it threaten'd alſo the Air of <hi>Germany,</hi> thought himſelf oblig'd to provide againſt it in time, and to prevent <hi>Holland</hi> from being ruin'd. Thereupon both he and the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> ſent ſeveral Auxiliary Troops to aſſiſt the States to ſupport them in their Wars, as alſo to divert the War from their Frontiers; thereby to preſerve the Empire, which the <hi>French</hi> already had attackt at the ſame time that they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to lull it aſleep, by pretending nothing but <hi>Neutrality, Propagation of the Catholick Faith, Everſion of Hereſie, and obſervation of the Old Treaties.</hi> He was much diſpleas'd to ſee that ſo many Princes of the Empire had ingag'd in the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> whoſe humour he well knew. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101014:74"/> that for mony he was become the ſlave of <hi>France.</hi> That upon the firſt opportunity his Imperial Majeſty, and the Empire ſhould find the Effects of his ill nature. That by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and at his inſtigations, ſo many Princes of the Empire had taken part with the <hi>French;</hi> and that perhaps many more would follow the ſame preſident. Thereupon he caus'd the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> as alſo the Biſhop to be ſolemnly ſummon'd, and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be demanded of them, in caſe of a War between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> to which ſide they would adhere? threatning to ruin their Countries if they did not reſolve within fifteen days. But the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> laught at the Emperor his Maſters ſummons, and at all his menaces and threats.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Duke of <hi>Burnonville</hi> in the month of <hi>February</hi> 1673. by order of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, caus'd a Paoclamation to be fix'd upon the Poſts, commanding all Officers and Souldiers who were Subjects of the Empire and in the ſervice of the Biſhops of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn</hi> to quit the ſervice of thoſe Princes and to repair to the Colours of his Imperial Majeſty upon pain of his high diſpleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> ſhew'd not only a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſobedience, but alſo an extraordinary Pride, accompany'd with a cautious arrogance, and his wonted wiles. For he publiſht a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proclamation,</hi> wherein he declar'd that the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101014:74"/> Proclamation that went under the Emperors name was none of his, but only a Stratagem of the Duke of <hi>Burnonvilles.</hi> That his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and in the ſervice of the Empire; and at length he promis'd to ſave them harmleſs from breach of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>He thought himſelf upon ſure grounds: For now <hi>Turenne</hi> having joyn'd his Forces with thoſe of the Biſhops of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> bent his march toward the City of <hi>Ham,</hi> which the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> had enforc'd with a Garriſon of two thouſand men, but they not finding themſelves ſufficient to reſiſt ſo great an Army, quitted the place of themſelves. There the <hi>French</hi> ſtopp'd; but the <hi>Epiſcopari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> advanc'd farther; as far as the City of <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> demanding contribution wherever they came.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time certain <hi>Friſans</hi> and <hi>Gronin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> making up a party together, took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the houſes of <hi>Schuylenburgh</hi> and <hi>Rech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teren,</hi> both ſeated upon a little River that runs to <hi>Zwoll,</hi> not far from the Fort <hi>de Ommen.</hi> Theſe are two old Caſtles ſurrounded with thick Walls and deep Moats; by the ſeizing of which they very much diſturb'd the <hi>Epiſcoparians,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby the opportunity to keep them in continual Alarams.</p>
            <p>Much about this time alſo there was great talk of a deſign which the ſon of one <hi>Keete,</hi> a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101014:75"/> Captain of Horſe, and Secretary for the County of <hi>Harragh,</hi> had againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> which was to betray both him and the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> into the hands of the Emperor: but in the end it prov'd but a bare report. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the <hi>French,</hi> taking an occaſion from them, plaid the Marquis of <hi>Grana,</hi> the Emperors Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at <hi>Cologn</hi> but a ſcurvy trick, ſending him a counterfeit Letter, Seal'd with the Seal of the Baron of <hi>Schwerin;</hi> the contents whereof were, that the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> was taken by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> Souldiers. Now the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was the ſaid Electors chief Miniſter of State, from whom this Letter was ſo contriv'd as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the Circumſtances of taking the Town; he that brought it alſo alledging himſelf to be an expreſs Meſſenger; ſo that the Marquis of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> never dreamt of any device put upon him, but immediately ſent away the News to all the Courts of his Maſters Allies, and it was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful news at firſt, till the Cheat came to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Friſelanders</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningers</hi> ſhew'd themſelves very vigilant, and did the Epiſcoparians much miſchief.</p>
            <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Coeverden</hi> intercepted a Convoy coming from <hi>Zwoll,</hi> laden with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to the Fort of <hi>Ommen,</hi> which they made bold to carry to their own Garriſon and there to ſhare the booties, which were not all the Biſhops loſſes at that time. For the Fort of <hi>Bourtang</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:101014:75"/> met with a party of his men and kill'd above two hundred upon the place; and which was worſe the Elector of <hi>Brandenburghs</hi> men, had met with two of his Regiments near <hi>Minden,</hi> which they ſo abſolutely defeated that very few eſcap'd their hands, which was the loſs alſo of the City of <hi>Hoxter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Epiſcoparians took the City of <hi>Hervoort,</hi> leaving therein eight hundred Souldiers who tormented the people after a moſt inhuman manner. The ſame outrages they alſo committed in the Province of <hi>Minden,</hi> but they durſt not meddle with the City. But theſe were ſmall refreſhings to the Biſhops; his heart mourn'd ſtill for <hi>Coeverden,</hi> and therefore he endeavour'd by all ways to make himſelf Maſter of that City once more; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he try'd all the tricks of underhand dealing but all in vain. Theſe failing he had ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Force; and therefore to make the ways paſſable for his Souldiers, he caus'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men under his juriſdiction to provide a great number of Hurdles twelve foot long and ſix foot broad, made of Sparrs bound together with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers, to lay where the Ways were deep and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe impaſſable; by means whereof he caus'd a ſtrong party of his men to march to <hi>Gransberghen,</hi> a houſe about two Leagues from <hi>Coeverden,</hi> and guarded by a Lieutenant and fifty ſix Souldiers, who bravely twice repuls'd the Enemy, but being over-power'd ſurrender'd
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101014:76"/> upon Articles, contrary to which, and Faith given, they were made Priſoners of War. Relief was ſent by the Garriſon of <hi>Coeverden,</hi> but it came too late for their own, but too ſoon for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops men; For the <hi>Dutch</hi> having laid an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh in the way by which the Enemy was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, they made a great Maſſacre of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coparians, and brought away their Priſoners.</p>
            <p>It was an ill time to vex the Biſhop after all theſe miſcarriages, as one of his Quarter-Maſters found by woful experience, who coming to ask the Biſhop for mony, put him into ſuch a fury, that he commanded the Officer to be ſhot to death, which was executed accordingly. An action which alienated from him, very much, the hearts of his Souldiers inſomuch that three whole Companies with their Officers quitted his ſervice, and marcht to <hi>Groningen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Excellency <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> found himſelf other work to do than to murther his own Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. He had already for ſome time kept the New Fort blockt up at a diſtance. But now taking along with him the Cavalry of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningen,</hi> and a good party of Foot out of <hi>Block-Zyll</hi> and other places, together with ſix pieces of Canon, and having forc'd the Fort <hi>Aux Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> to make his way through, he laid cloſe Siege to the Place. The Biſhop well knowing the importance of the Fortreſs prepar'd with all diligence to relieve it. And firſt he ſent Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Meynertſhagen</hi> with a thouſand Dragoons and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101014:76"/> Foot, to get into the Fort, but they were beaten off. After that he endeavour'd with a ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>my of five thouſand men under the Command of the Count of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> not only to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, but alſo to reinforce the Garriſon. He furiouſly aſſail'd Collonel <hi>Aquila's</hi> Quarter, but he was ſo warmly receiv'd, that he was forc'd to retreat in the night after a conſiderable loſs. The next day he renew'd his Attack, but with the ſame ſucceſs, leaving four hundred of his men behind him, ſlain and taken Priſoners. Among the ſlain were Collonel <hi>Wedel</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar,</hi> Majors <hi>Swante</hi> and <hi>Keſſe.</hi> Eighteen Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and two Lieutenant Collonels. Soon after the Victors, having taken the Redoubt which lay above the Dike of <hi>Stocſterhorn,</hi> gain'd the Fort, where he found good ſtore of rich Pillage both in Gold and Silver, and took the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, two Lieutenant Collonels, five Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and four hundred Souldiers Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The richneſs of the Plunder ſhew'd that Country was not very kindly dealt with; but among all the Biſhops Impoſitions, he had one that was particular, which he only levy'd upon thoſe of the Reformed Religion. They that made profeſſion thereof in the City of <hi>Otmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> were to pay a thouſand Crowns, in the City of <hi>Goor</hi> a thouſand ſix hundred Crowns, and ſo proportionably in other Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and beſides this he took from them the uſe of their Churches. The King of <hi>France</hi> nor
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101014:77"/> his Governour the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> were never ſo ſevere to the Inhabitans of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> though they were rigorous enough. Their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were grievous, yet they were equally lay'd as well upon the Catholicks as upon thoſe of the Proteſtant Relipion, the Eccleſiaſticks not being exempted: One of the moſt eminent of that order went to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> requeſting him to ſpare the Catholicks, and to burthen only the Hereticks, as well in their Contributions and Quartering of Souldiers; but he gave them a refuſal in theſe words; As ye live, eat and drink together, ſo ye muſt pay your Taxes every one a like. Upon the ſame errand alſo the new Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> went to the King, but he found never the better reception. Nay ſome obſerv'd, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were rather favour'd, than thoſe of the <hi>Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which caus'd ſome of them to ſay, our Maſter ſeems to be a thrice Chriſtian Devil rather than a thrice Chriſtian King.</p>
            <p>It was now toward the Latter end of the Summer, when the Biſhop thinking he had been too idle all the year before, he randevouz'd his Forces between <hi>Haſſelt</hi> and <hi>Swoll</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeven thouſand Horſe and ſeventy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Foot, which joyn'd with the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians at <hi>Roveen,</hi> immediately they took their march toward <hi>Steenwich,</hi> waſting all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Drenthe</hi> as they went; which inforc'd the Garriſon of <hi>Groningen</hi> to ſend forth nine Troops
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101014:77"/> of Horſe, and two of Dragoons, for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſaid Province. In the mean time the Enemy was advanc'd as far as <hi>Schoten,</hi> with a deſign to make themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Heeren Veen,</hi> and ſo to break that way into <hi>Friſeland.</hi> Upon which the States of <hi>Friſeland</hi> Muſter'd together a little Army of about eight thouſand Foot, and a hundred Cornets of Horſe, and ſent them toward the <hi>Heeren-Veen</hi> to oppoſe the Epiſcoparians who finding ſuch proviſion made againſt them, and that they could not force their paſſage, retreated, and marcht with all their forces toward <hi>Steenwick.</hi> There the <hi>Munſterians</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> parted; the latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into their Winter Quarters at <hi>Zutphen, Arnbeim, Doesburgh</hi> and other places, having loſt in all eight hundred men in this march.</p>
            <p>Certain it is that the Biſhop promis'd himſelf great matters, could he have made his intended Incurſion into <hi>Friſeland;</hi> for the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> being now enter'd into an Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> he had nothing to fear from that ſide of the world; though by the care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the <hi>Friſelanders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he made no other advantage of it than the loſs of eight hundred men already mention'd.</p>
            <p>The Emperor all this while obſerving the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances made with the King of <hi>France</hi> by his own ſubjects and members of the Empire to the common prejudice, thought it now but time to ſend a conſiderable force toward the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101014:78"/> for the ſatisfaction of the world publiſh'd his reaſons for ſo doing, which conſiſted of theſe heads. Firſt, for that the King of <hi>France</hi> had marcht his Forces through the Territories of the Empire to Aſſail the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and taken many places in the ſame Territories contrary to the Peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi> Secondly, Becauſe the ſaid Souldiers ſtill quarter'd upon the ſubjects of the Empire at their own pleaſure committed ſeveral Extortions and Rapines upon them, and particularly had burnt the Bridg of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>French</hi> had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Treves,</hi> where they did nothing but burn, plunder and ſpil. Fourthly, Becauſe the Elector of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> contrary to the Peace concluded at <hi>Cleves</hi> in the year 1666. had undertaken an Offenſive War againſt the States of the United Provinces, with the conſent of the Emperorr and Empire, and rejecting the Emperors commands to the contrary.</p>
            <p>During theſe Paper Skirmiſhes, the <hi>French</hi> were got into the heart of the United Provinces, though ſoon after the face of their ſucceſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to change. The Inundations in <hi>Holland,</hi> had put a ſtop to their Conqueſts there. The Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> had been repuls'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Friſeland</hi> and <hi>Groningen,</hi> inſomuch that he deſpair'd of doing any good in thoſe parts; though he did all he could to regain <hi>Coeverden.</hi> To which purpoſe all the Summer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101014:78"/> long he had very much diſtreſs'd the ſaid Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>orc'd to yield for want of water. The Dam that carry'd off the water was wonderfully ſtrong, two Leagues and a half in length, and three or four Foot broad at the Bottom, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight at the top. Beſides the Epiſcoparians had built two Forts to Guard it, and planted above ſixty pieces of Ordnance upon the Dam to prevent any coming near it. So that when the Biſhop underſtood how high the water was riſen, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he to ſome of his Officers, <hi>the Devil cannot hinder me from taking</hi> Coever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But upon the firſt of <hi>October</hi> aroſe ſuch a terrible ſtorm as deſtroy'd all the Labour and Travel of the Epiſcoparians, and made ſuch a gap in the Dam, that all the Art and Induſtry of the Enemy could never repair again. And after that, the Tempeſt continuing brake down three gaps more, and drown'd four or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers that were upon the Guard of the Dike; and carry'd away Collonel <hi>Horſtmans</hi> Coach, with ſeveral Ladies in it.</p>
            <p>A little before this the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had taken <hi>Narden</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> which caus'd a great conſternation at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht.</hi> But that which troubl'd them more was, that the Prince began to bend his march toward <hi>Germany,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reinforc'd by the Imperial Troops he had beſieg'd the City of <hi>Bon,</hi> which he alſo took to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101014:79"/> with ſome other places; which made the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> afraid leſt by making farther Conqueſt he ſhould cut off all Commerce and Correſpondence between them and the Enemy. And it appeared by the offer of Neutrality which they made in behalf of the City and Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> in what a pannick dread they were, though the proffer would not be accepted. They alſo offer the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to change their Province with him for that of <hi>Over-Yſſel;</hi> nay they offered to give it him, provided he would joyn with the Forces which were in <hi>Germany,</hi> but he did not accept their kindneſs, whether the Biſhop conſidered the turn of Affairs, or whither he had not time ſufficient to Conſult and Treat. However it were, the King of <hi>France</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to quit all the places which he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd; of which <hi>Woerden</hi> was the firſt; and after that the City of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> though very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh'd by the exactions of her new Maſters.</p>
            <p>Tis thought that the main reaſons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the King of <hi>France</hi> to quit his new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, were firſt the March of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> into <hi>Germany.</hi> 2. The Alliance between the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States General. 3. His deſpair of gaining any thing upon <hi>Holland,</hi> without which his other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts were but a burthen to him. 4.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101014:79"/> in the year 74. 5. He was afraid leſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologn</hi> ſhould change their ſides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>All this while the Biſhop had a longing deſire to be Maſter of <hi>Groningen,</hi> not that he was in hopes to gain the place; but that he had a deſign to Plunder the Country, and to gratifie his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Souldiers with a good Booty, which was all the Pay they received from him. To which purpoſe in <hi>February</hi> he Muſter'd together
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101014:80"/> 4000 Horſe, and ſent them toward the Province, but all the Gates were ſo faſt bar'd, and ſo well guarded, that there was no good to be done.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide his Excellency <hi>Rabenhaupt</hi> march'd with his <hi>Frizons</hi> through the City of <hi>Coverden</hi> toward the County of <hi>Benthem.</hi> At his firſt arrival he took the City of <hi>Northorn,</hi> wherein he left 16 Colours of Horſe, and 6 of Foot. From whence he advanc'd toward <hi>Nyenhuys,</hi> but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence by the way, that Epiſcoparians had again begirt the City of <hi>Northorn,</hi> and beat off the Out-Guards, his Excellency marcht back toward them, with ſeven Troops of Horſe, and five Regiments of Foot, and ſet upon them the fifth of <hi>April,</hi> but they ſtill Retreated, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them Sixty Slain and Fifty Priſoners, with the loſs only of three men. Two days after <hi>Raben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haupt</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Nyenhuys</hi> by force, and thereby opened his way into the Biſhops own Territories.</p>
            <p>Upon that the Biſhop began to fear, leſt he ſhould be forſaken by the <hi>French,</hi> who had already quitted the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and ſeveral other places in the other Provinces, and ſo the flame of the War would blaze out in his own Territories. For indeed the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had plunder'd ſeveral of his Towns; and the <hi>Friſelanders</hi> had fairly begun on their ſide. Upon theſe conſiderations he began to forget the Alliance which he had made with <hi>France,</hi> from whence he had received ſuch conſiderable ſums, and for all that the King
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101014:80"/> promis'd him the utmoſt of his Aſſiſtance. And therefore by his Envoys at <hi>Cologn,</hi> he ſought to be reſtored to the favour, and to be admitted into the Alliance of the Emperor; which at length he obtain'd, and a Peace was concluded between him, the Emperour, and the States General.</p>
            <p>As for the Emperor he promis'd to ſubmit to him, to renounce the Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and to be regulated according to the Reſolutions taken at <hi>Regensburgh</hi> for the defence of the Princes and Circles of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The agreement made with the States General was to this effect. That there ſhould be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Peace between them; That there ſhould be a reciprocal Amneſty, and Act of Oblivion for all things paſt, ſince the Peace of <hi>Cleves,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſuch as were guilty of Treaſon; That the Biſhop immediately after the Ratification, ſhould reſtore all the Places, Towns, Cities and Villages, without any exception, which he had Conquer'd or taken from the States; and that he ſhould reſtore to the Subjects of the States all their Lands, Signiories, and Houſes which he had detain'd from them during the War. That the Peace of <hi>Cleves</hi> ſhould be of full force and effect in all things not contrary to this preſent Treaty.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> in their Conquer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d Cities having intelligence of this Peace, durſt not hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there any longer, though they extorted great ſums of mony from the Inhabitants before they departed, from <hi>Woerden</hi> 16000 Livers, <hi>Bommel 36000, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht 45000, Campen 80000, Thuel 22000, Zutphen</hi> 70000 for Contribution, and 70000 to ſave their Fortifications, <hi>Anberm</hi> 14000 for the Governor, and 100000 for the King, <hi>Nimmeghen</hi> 55000, and the Upper and Lower <hi>Betuwe</hi> the ſame ſum. As for <hi>Weſel, Enmerſch</hi> and <hi>Rees,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> had given them to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> ſo that he retain'd in his hands nothing of his Conqueſts from the States, but <hi>Graef</hi> and <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> the firſt of which places was valiantly recover'd by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the latter reſtor'd by the Peace.</p>
            <p>At what time the <hi>French</hi> quitted their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> quitted alſo the City of <hi>Deventer</hi> after he had made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for 42000 Crowns, for Contribution mony. The <hi>Munſterians</hi> alſo in purſuance of the Treaty quitted the Cities of <hi>Haſſelts, Swartſluys,</hi> and <hi>Zwoll,</hi> after they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſeveral diſorders in the Country.</p>
            <p>This turn of the tide no way pleas'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks. At <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> and in ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, they were in hopes that the <hi>French</hi> would return; and that then they ſhould be put into poſſeſſion of the Government of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101014:81"/> nay they gave it out ſo in publick. They were ſo obſtinate at <hi>Otmarſum,</hi> that they would not ſurrender their Churches to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, which caus'd ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at firſt, though they were quickly appeas'd.</p>
            <p>But though the Peace between the Emperor, the States General, and the Biſhop of <hi>Cologn,</hi> were thus concluded; yet the Elector of <hi>Cologn</hi> did not ſo ſoon forſake the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill incens'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> However his Imperial Majeſty had preſcrib'd him a time to declare himſelf which was near expiration. One main obſtacle was that he could not brook, that the Emperor ſhould keep a Garriſon in the City of <hi>Bon.</hi> He alſo deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the States, as the price of his Friendſhip, the County of <hi>Meurs,</hi> the City of <hi>Rynbork,</hi> and forty thouſand Crowns toward the expences of the War. But the States would allow him none of his Pretenſions, only they were willing he ſhould put a Garriſon into <hi>Rynborck,</hi> but that he ſhould renounce all his claim to the County of <hi>Meurs.</hi> He had alſo demanded free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Catholick Religion in the Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> but the Emperors Embaſſadors, well knowing it would never be granted, declar'd to him that it was not a reaſonable requeſt. For that the States General never permitted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Catholick Religion in any of their Territories. Thereupon ſeeing the Cloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he quitted all his pretenſions, and upon that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101014:82"/> a Peace followed between the Emperor and him, as alſo betwixt him and States General; the chief Articles whereof were, That there ſhould be a firm and laſting Peace; that after the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Treaty, the Elector ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the States all the Places which he had taken from them during the War, in the ſame Condition as they were before they were taken, without any waſt or ſpoil, or any demand of Contribution. That he ſhould keep the ſums already paid, but that he ſhould releaſe the the Hoſtages which he detain'd for the payment of ſuch ſums as were demanded. That all Lands and Signiories taken from the Subjects of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> ſhall be reſtored them. On the other ſide that the State ſhould quit all their pretenſions to the Town of <hi>Rynbork</hi> and the Fortifications thereof. The County of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the two Biſhops never dreamt that the Face of Affairs would have alter'd after ſo ſtrange a manner, and that they ſhould be forc'd to beg for Peace from the States. More eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was deceiv'd, who in the month of <hi>July,</hi> before ſent to the City of <hi>Embden</hi> to ſend their Deputies to him, to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> there to conſult about ſuch things as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their repoſe and ſecurity. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Embden</hi> had ſet themſelves in an exact Neutrality all the time of the War, however they ſend their Deputies to the place appointed,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101014:82"/> with his demands, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Citizens of <hi>Embden,</hi> ſhould diſmiſs the States Garriſon, and receive into the Town for their ſecurity two thouſand of the Biſhops Souldiers. To which the Deputies making anſwer, that they could not conſent to any ſuch propoſal, till they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their High and Mightineſſes, How ſaid the Biſhops Commiſſioners, who are they? To which one of the Deputies from <hi>Embden</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the States General were ſufficiently known to all the world. Yes, the other made anſwer, They were ſo formerly, but now the world knows no ſuch ſort of men. Upon which reply the Deputies from <hi>Embden</hi> took their leaves; and gave their Magiſtracy an accompt of what had paſs'd. But they had no ſuch low and contemtible thoughts of the States as the Biſhop had, and therefore gave him an abſolute denyal to his demand.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the King of <hi>France</hi> was greatly offended at the two Biſhops, becauſe they had made a Peace with the Emperor and the States. <hi>Munſter</hi> excus'd himſelf by his Agent, that he had been conſtrain'd to make a Peace with the States, becauſe that the next Spring, he ſhould have otherwiſe been aſſail'd not only by the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> but alſo by the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh.</hi> But the King was not at all ſatisfied with this excuſe, and that ſo much the leſs, becauſe he had taken the other ſide, and ſent all his men to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101014:83"/> who being arriv'd in the parts about <hi>Cologn,</hi> began to mutiny, being thereto incited by the <hi>French</hi> that were among them, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them that if they would ſerve the King of <hi>France</hi> he would allow them thirty Crowns a man. So that many of the Regiment of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Nagel</hi> kill'd their Officers, and deſerted their Colours. But this Mutiny was ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd by hanging ſome of the principal Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders, and paying off the reſt of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As for the Biſhop he had promis'd the Emperor by a Collateral agreement to ſupply him the next Spring, in the year 167<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. with a body of ten thouſand men; but he found it a difficult task to be as good as his word, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that the ſix thouſand that had winter'd in <hi>Alſatia</hi> were reduc'd to two thouſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orſe and three hundred Foot.</p>
            <p>Thus the King of <hi>France</hi> loſt two Friends but in the lieu of them, the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a Mediator, ſhew'd himſelf an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Allies, and though to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, had in a Hoſtile manner aſſail'd the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the States General aſſiſted the ſaid Elector, being thereto oblig'd by their reciprocal Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and their own Intereſt. Which caus'd the King of <hi>Sueden</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> 1675. to ſend an Embaſſador to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> to deſire him not to give paſſage to the Forces which the States ſhould ſend through his Territories to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:101014:83"/> In which Affairs the Biſhop carry'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fairly enough, for he made uſe of no flams or delays either on the one ſide or the other, but gave this plain anſwer, that he ſhould be ſorry there ſhould be any War between the Crown of <hi>Sueden</hi> and the States General or their Allies, but if any ſuch thing ſhould happen, that he was bound to obey the Orders of his <hi>Imperial</hi> Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And the more to approve himſelf the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors ſervant, in <hi>June</hi> the ſame year, he told the Sieur <hi>Fiſcher</hi> the Emperors Embaſſador who gave him a viſit at <hi>Coeſvelt,</hi> that M. <hi>Verjus</hi> the King of <hi>Frances</hi> Embaſſador had earneſtly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited him with promiſe of great matters to take his part, or at leaſt to obſerve an exact Neutrality; but that he was reſolv'd not to lend an Ear to his Enchantments. Some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him highly for it, and look'd upon his refuſal, as a ſign of his Fidelity to the Empire, and believ'd he would mend in his Old Age. Though others were of opinion, that if his words were true, he ſpake them not ſo much from the reality of his Intentions, as out of fear of being utterly ruin'd; for otherwiſe, ſaid they, he would never have refus'd the Gold of <hi>France,</hi> which he lov'd ſo dearly: for the mony deſign'd him was afterwards expended in <hi>Italy, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> for the raiſing of new men.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:101014:84"/>
            <p>More than that in purſuit of his Allyance with the Emperor, he rais'd a body of eight thouſand men in the Counties of <hi>Rheeda</hi> and <hi>Rhitbergh,</hi> with an intention to march with this little Army towards <hi>Bremen,</hi> and to have done the <hi>Swedes</hi> what miſchief he could. But in the interim he receiv'd Orders from his <hi>Imperial</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to march toward the County of <hi>Lippe,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he obey'd, carrying along with him ſeveral great Guns, and put a Garriſon into the City of <hi>Blombergh.</hi> He alſo beſieg'd <hi>Lemgou,</hi> for refuſing him entrance, and took it without any great trouble together with <hi>Waerentbolts;</hi> and when he had ſo done, he made the County pay him a Contribution of twelve thouſand Crowns. He alſo did his utmoſt to draw the Duke of <hi>Hanover</hi> to his party, and to perſuade him to quit the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> ſo that now he ſhew'd himſelf as paſſionate an Enemy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appeared a zealous Friend to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Enmity to the <hi>Swede</hi> proceeded from his unhandſome proceedings, in that he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly taken part with the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to his promiſes of Aſſiſtance, to which he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by the Triple Alliance and other Treaties, and contrary to the trſt repoſed in him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd ſeveral ſums of mony to raiſe an Auxiliary Force. For theſe reaſons he poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Territory of <hi>Wildeshuyſen</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Juriſdiction of <hi>Bremen;</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101014:84"/> the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of the Cities of <hi>Telgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buyſen</hi> and <hi>Verden,</hi> and being aſſiſted by the Forces of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> he made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Otterbergh</hi> and <hi>Buxtehude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe Tranſactions he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made another Alliance with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States General; wherein he had promis'd to ſupply them with three thouſand men for a certain ſum of money, but that theſe Levies ſhould remain with the reſt of the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>-Troops to act with the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>French;</hi> or where abſolute neceſſity ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their aſſiſtance. Or if the States deſir'd more men, the Biſhop oblig'd himſelf to furniſh them with eight Thouſand Foot, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, provided that they pay'd them in the ſame manner as they payd the three thouſand already rais'd. This Treaty was to laſt ten years after the expiration of the preſent War. And in caſe that either of the three Confederates were invaded, that the other two ſhould aſſiſt him that was firſt aſſail'd. That is to ſay, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States ſhould aſſiſt the Biſhop with two thouſand Horſe, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and that the Biſhop ſhould aſſiſt them with five hundred Foot, and a thouſand Horſe.</p>
            <p>But in regard that all which the Biſhop acted afterwards was in common with the reſt of the Allies, we ſhall forbear to ſpeak of theſe things, which ſhould we undertake, we ſhould be forc'd to make an entire Hiſtory of the Wars in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101014:85"/> Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> which would far exceed the purpoſe of this ſhort Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Thus then we have given an accompt of the Birth of this Biſhop, or at leaſt we have ſaid as much as we could poſſibly learn concerning it. We have alſo given the Reader an account of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his Humour and his Diſpoſition, all which have appear'd ſufficiently by his Actions.

               </gap>cts of his Martial and quarrelſom humour, which diſplay'd it ſelf firſt againſt his own Subjects, then againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Members of the Empire, and ſoon after againſt the States General. We have ſhew'd the troubles and quarrels that aroſe in the Election of his Coadjutor and ſucceſſor. And laſtly how he ſold himſelf to ſeveral Princes to ſatisfie his Avarice and Hatred, and how he deſerted them upon the change of their Fortune.</p>
            <p>Moſt certainly he impoveriſh'd and ruin'd his Subjects by his continual Wars, which were ſtill voluntarily undertaken, and the occaſions ſought by himſelf; in the maintaining of which he did more than ordinary miſchief and damage to his Neighbours. More eſpecially he was the particular plague of <hi>Munſter, Drenthe,</hi> and <hi>Twente,</hi> of <hi>Groneng,</hi> and <hi>Over-Yſſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon all theſe Tranſactions of his Dignify'd Life, ſome have made theſe obſervations:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101014:85"/> 1. That the Biſhop made ſo little advantage by all his Wars, unleſs perhaps that he might hoard up ſome conſiderable Sums of ready money, that he made no addition to his Territories, and by that at his latter end he wan ſome few places from the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Verdon;</hi> which advantages, loſt again ſoon after his death, could in no meaſure recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the ruin of his own Subjects and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, of which he himſelf was the only occaſion, nor be compar'd to the loſs of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men ſlain, murder'd plunder'd and undon by his means. 2. That though he were a Prince of ſmall Power, and the Maſter of but a ſlender Dominion, yet that ſtill be ſo order'd his affairs, as to oblige Potent Kings to take his part, and with immenſe Sums to purchaſe his Friendſhip: but that ſo happen'd, by reaſon of the ſituation of his Country, ſo commodiouſly ſeated among his Neighbours. 3. That having ſo many and ſuch Potent Adverſaries, and having ſo often ran ſuch perillous hazards, he has ſtill warded off the fatal blow by his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and ſeaſonable Change of Parties. 4. That he ſhould always have Souldiers at his ſervice, and ſeveral Volunteers, though he paid them ſo ill, and many times gave them nothing at all. But the reaſon of that was plain, in regard he gave them an uncontroul'd Liberty to commit all manner of Enormities, Rapines, and Spoils, even upon his very Allies, not excuſing his own
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101014:86"/> Subjects from the ſame Oppreſſion. 5. That though he liv'd in perpetual trouble, and ſpent his days in the continual Toyls of War, yet that he ſhould arrive at ſo fair an Age, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver moleſted with Diſeaſes but ſtill retaining an admirable vigour both of body and mind.</p>
            <p>To tell the Cauſes of his reſtleſs Activity will be eaſie; when we conſider, 1. His unquiet and turbulent diſpoſition, that would never ſuffer him to be in Repoſe, and which was alſo heigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ned and inflamed by the inſtigations of others. 2. The hatred and rancour which he bare the States General, ariſing from ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Wrong, or rather from his Religion, as being ſo embitter'd againſt thoſe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, that he could have kill'd them all with his own hands. 3. His Ambition and Deſire of rendring himſelf renowned by his Wars. 4. His Avarice and Greedineſs to heap up great ſums of ready mony for himſelf and his Heirs. 5. His vain expectations of being made Pope, in conſideration of his Wars againſt the Hereticks, and his Zeal for the Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p>For he was wont to ſay, <hi>He is not worthy to be great who makes it not his Endeavour to grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; wherein if the ſucceſs do not anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, however he ſhall gain the Reputation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done great things. His reſolutions are in his own power, but the ſucceſs is in the hands of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which willingly aſſiſts the couragious.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:101014:86"/>
            <p>As this was one of his chief Apophthegms, I find but few more that were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Record either of Hiſtory or Tradition.</p>
            <p>Being advis'd by one of his intimate friends not to undertake the firſt War againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> who told him that he would in the end prove too weak for them, that had ſo long withſtood, and done ſo much miſchief to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for fourſcore years together. He made anſwer, <hi>Come, Come, Little Saints ſomtimes work great Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, when a little after his being advanced to his dignity, He was Counſell'd to deal gently with the City of <hi>Munſter. No Prince,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can be called powerful whoſe Power does not extend it ſelf over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being told, the firſt time that he made Peace with the States, That he had loſt more than he had got by the War, <hi>Princes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that go to War, are like Gameſters at Trick Track; for the Dice will not always run as they would have them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reported alſo that one time he ſaid to one of his Generals, <hi>A little pretence of Right will juſtifie a whole War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as our Biſhop had his Vices, certainly he was not without ſome Eminent Vertues, though I muſt confeſs I never yet could be informed what they were, and muſt therefore be forced to bury them in ſilence.</p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:101014:87"/>
            <p>At length the Fatal hour came, which gave him to underſtand, that the Greateſt Princes are but vanity it ſelf, and no more than the meaneſt among men.</p>
            <p>He lamented very cordially that he had ſo much over burthened his Subjects, and that his Government had been ſo cruel toward them; but he pleaded, That it was out of neceſſity, and to reſiſt his Enemies.</p>
            <p>He was very much troubled about his debts; and a little before he expir'd he order'd his Executors, among whom was the Sub Dean and Doctor <hi>Ham,</hi> to take particular care to ſee them paid, telling them withal, that though he knew he ow'd much, yet he was very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that there was ſufficient to diſcharge them all; which he left to their Conſciences, as knowing where his money lay.</p>
            <p>He order'd the ſum of twenty thouſand Crowns for the expences of his Funeral. He caus'd four Silver Candleſticks to be made of the value of two thouſand Crowns apiece, to ſtand upon the Altar of the Chappel where he was interred, for the Wax-Candles that were to be kept perpetually burning. He alſo appointed the fourth of <hi>November</hi> to be the day of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and that the ſame day a Chapter ſhould be call'd to introduce the new Biſhop. He alſo caus'd a Siver Ship to be made, in memory of a <hi>French</hi> Ship that he had taken upon the Coaſt of <hi>Frieſland;</hi> though others ſay 'twas only a ſmall
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101014:87"/> Barque made Uſe of for the Unlading of Greater Veſſels.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the breath was out of his body every one ſeiz'd upon what they could ſnatch; carrying away, not only his mony, but alſo all the gold and ſilver Moveables in his Chamber; nay they ſtript him of the meaneſt things that were in the Chamber, leaving him alone as it were in a ranſackt Room.</p>
            <p>He had Govern'd the Dioceſs twenty eight years, though the accompt of his Age is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reported, ſome allowing him ſeventy one, others ſeventy two years. In the year 1667. at the Election of his Succeſſor, he acknowledg'd himſelf in the ſixtieth year of his Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which time to his death we reckon full eleven years; which is the trueſt accompt we can give of his Age.</p>
            <p>The preſent Biſhop his Succeſſor, ſoon after his Death, publiſh'd a Pious Exhortation to all his Subject, to betake themſelves to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions and Prayers for the Soul of the decas'd, in theſe words.</p>

                        <head>To the Venerable Clergy and well beloved People of the City and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Munſter,</hi> perpetual Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Lord.</head>
                        <p>IT hath pleaſed him who takes away the Souls of Princes when he pleaſes, to call from this life to a better, our dear Brother, Couſin and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, the Sieur <hi>Chriſtopher Bernard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> Adminiſtratour of <hi>Corvey,</hi> Lord of <hi>Borkelo,</hi> after he had Govern'd the Dioceſs of <hi>Munſter</hi> to his immortal praiſe, with a care truly Paternal. And though we make no doubt, but that his Subjects, who in his life time lov'd him as a Father, and reverenc'd him as their Prince, will not be wanting in their Chriſtian Duties and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which they owe to the Deceas'd: Nevertheleſs we have thought fit to admoniſh and ordain with the advice of our Reverend Chapter, That all Prieſts, as well Secular as Regular, depending upon the Dioceſs of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in the dayly Oblation of the Holy Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and others in their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101014:88"/> dayly Prayers, do, with all humility recommend the Soul of this great Prince to the abound Mercy of our Lord, to the end he may obtain Eternal Salvation among the Bleſſed Souls whom he had made himſelf known upon Earth by his Vertues and Heroic Acts.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it has pleas'd the Omnipotent to lay the burthen of the Succeſſion upon our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, after a lawful Election approv'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick and Imperial Authority: We knowing the importance thereof, and deeply ſenſible of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Troubles and Evils that threaten us on every ſide: earneſtly deſire the Prayers and Charity of our devout Subjects, that our weakneſs, being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Power of God, may be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Charge committed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, through the Merits and Common Prayers of our people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Thus we have ſeen the death of the ſo much renowned Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> the Sieur <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Bernard;</hi> full of years, yet enjoying the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his ſenſes to the laſt gaſp. And as it was his chance to be advanc'd juſt after the Peace made with the Emperor, <hi>France, Spain, Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:101014:89"/> and the United Provinces; ſo he alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to dye preſently after the Peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>States General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His death reſtor'd both Quiet and Repoſe to all his Neighbours, who were ſtill afraid that ſo ſoon as the Emperor and <hi>France</hi> ſhould be agreed, he would be cutting out new Employment for himſelf; for he never fail'd of a pretence. But Providence has better provided for them. For they may now aſſure themſelves of ſecurity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of his Succeſſor the preſent Biſhop, and his Subjects may hope for an Age of Silver after that of Iron, as now paſſed off with the precedeing Biſhop. For it is affirmed that he is a Prince mild and pacifick, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all ſorts of trouble, and one that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the Deſolations of War; and beſides all this, a lover of Learning and Learned men: and it is Generally obſerv'd that thoſe Provinces are uſually moſt happy, whoſe Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Learning before War, and Books before Armies.</p>
            <p>True it is that upon his Election to be Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor and Succeſſor, ſeveral Quarrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions aroſe between the Biſhop deceas'd and a good part of the <hi>Members</hi> of the Chapter; but we are aſſur'd that the preſent Biſhop had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any hand in thoſe Diſputes, nor ever affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the leaſt Fuel to foment them.

                  <p>BEcauſe there are various Reports concerning the affair, of the truth whereof you deſire me to inform you; I thought my ſelf oblig'd to give you the beſt ſatisfaction I could: In order to which I have diſcourſed the moſt Ancient and moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons in theſe parts, who all agree that the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was conceiv'd in Priſon at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergeerde,</hi> but that he was born in his Fathers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Biſpink.</hi> For it happen'd that the Father of the Biſhop, whoſe name was <hi>Gaten Biſpink,</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad ſeveral Quarrels with Marſhal <hi>Morien,</hi> Lord of <hi>Noorkirk</hi> his Neighbour, about the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Hunting. Which continuing, one time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, the Marſhal ſeiz'd <hi>Gatens</hi> Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Dogs, and ſhut them up ſo long, till they eat one another for want of food. Soon after they both came to <hi>Munſter,</hi> where <hi>Gaten</hi> meeting the Marſhal, ask'd him when he would ſend him his Huntſmen and his Dogs home? To which <hi>Morien</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:101014:90"/> reply'd, very ſuddenly; and withal told <hi>Gaten</hi> that he had certain Papers about him that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the buſineſs; but inſtead of ſhewing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, threw off his Cloak, and drew his Sword. <hi>Gaten,</hi> though be had been Drinking hard, drew his Sword half out, and parly'd a while, till ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity conſtrain'd him, and that his Servants call to him to have a care of himſelf: at what time he drew his Sword quite out and ſlew his Aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. The Fact being thus Committed, <hi>Gaten</hi> never abſented himſelf, and was therefore Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd in the Caſtle of <hi>Bevergeerde;</hi> and when his Judges allowed him to chooſe an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, he refuſed to do it, but pleaded his own Cauſe, and carry'd his buſineſs ſo well, that at length his Wife was permitted to come and live with him; and ſo it came to paſs that our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was Begot and Conceived in Priſon. True it is that his Father was at length acquitted, but he had vow'd not to ſtir out of Priſon till his Proſecutors had paid him all the Coſts of his Impriſonment and his Suit, which had laſted thirteen years; ſo that his Wife being near her time, return'd to <hi>Biſpinck,</hi> where ſhe lay in. After the Father was dead, the Son was made a Canon of <hi>Munſter;</hi> and being much enclin'd to War, and well verſed in Military Affairs, he was made firſt <hi>Commiſſary at War;</hi> and at length, after the death of the laſt Biſhop, advanced to the Epiſcopal Dignity.</p>

                  <p>AFter I had Read your Letter, I made all the Enquiry I could to ſatisfie your Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; but becauſe there are few alive that were living at that time, there is very little of truth and reality to be reported. Certain it is that the ſaid Biſhop was begot in Priſon, to which his Father was Committed for Murther. But Opinions are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous touching the Right of the Occaſion, whether it were on his ſide or no. The Favourers of the deceaſed Biſhop will have his Father to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though others believe that no man durſt ſay otherwiſe while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Moſt certain it is that there were deſperate Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels between the Biſhops Father (who was call'd <hi>Gaten Biſpink,</hi> from his Caſtle of <hi>Biſpink)</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill they were ſtarv'd to death. A while after they met at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Gaten</hi> being in drink, asked <hi>Morien</hi> for his Dogs in very ſharp and abuſive terms, threatning the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101014:91"/> Marſhal withal. <hi>B. Morien</hi> being a perſon of Courage, and not able to brook ſuch Language, laid his hand upon his Sword and told <hi>Gaten</hi> that he was ready to anſwer him with his Sword in his hand. Some ſay that <hi>Gaten</hi> declin'd the Combat, and that he was at length compell'd to fight in his own defence; others affirm that he immediately drew and fell on. However it were, the Marſhal was ſlain, and <hi>Gaten</hi> Impriſoned at <hi>Bevergeerde,</hi> where he dy'd in ſome few years after. It is reported that his Judges had given him leave to go home, after they had examin'd the Fact: but he refus'd to ſtir till the Kindred of the perſon ſlain ſhould pay him all the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Impriſonment; Though others believe that to be very improbable, and an Invention only to free him from Scandal and Ignominy of a tedious fourteen years Thraldom.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:101014:91"/> as much exclaim'd againſt and condemn'd, which proceeds from the various judgments that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or hatred makes upon the Cauſes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Crime.</p>
